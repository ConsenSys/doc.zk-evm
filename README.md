# Linea documentation

[Linea](https://linea.build/) is a developer-ready Layer 2 network, scaling Ethereum by providing an Ethereum-equivalent
environment in which to execute transactions, which are then submitted to Ethereum Mainnet through a
zero-knowledge rollup.

This documentation repository is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), and the doc
site is published at [`docs.linea.build`](https://docs.linea.build/).
