# Linea documentation

[Linea](https://linea.build/) is a developer-ready layer 2 network, scaling Ethereum by providing
an Ethereum-equivalent environment in which to execute transactions, which are then submitted to
Ethereum Mainnet through a zero-knowledge rollup.

This documentation repository is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), and the site
itself is published at [`docs.linea.build`](https://docs.linea.build/).

See [more](https://docs-template.consensys.net/) information about how Consensys uses Docusaurus.

## Running locally

You will need to have Node.js installed to run the live previews of the docs locally.

It is highly recommended that you use a tool like [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)
to manage Node.js versions on your machine.

### Installing recommended Node.js version with `nvm`

1. Follow the above instructions to install `nvm` on your machine, or go [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).
2. Go to the root folder of this project in your terminal.
3. Run `nvm install` followed by `nvm use`. This will install the version specified by this project in the `.nvmrc` file.

### Running this project

1. Navigate to root folder of the project after installing Node.js
2. Run the following in sequence, which only needs to be done once:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. To preview and for every time afterwards:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

### Build

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static
contents hosting service.

To run the local build you created, run:

   ```bash
   npm run serve
   ```

### Adding new words to the dictionary

This repository includes a _linter_, which you can think of as a spell-check that also checks code
formatting and standards, and a lot more. It's possible that you might use a word in your content
that is not known to the linter, and your build, or commit, will fail.

You can run the linter any time with the command `npm run lint`.

If the linter finds a word that it doesn't recognize, take a look at `project-words.txt` in the root
directory; if the word that the linter caught is correctly spelled, and you wish it to pass the
linter's test, add it to `project-words.txt`, save, add and commit those changes, and see if it
passes.

For tidiness, please ensure you adhere to the alphabetical order established in `project-words.txt`.
