### Contribution Guidelines

#### Technical Requirements

- Use `.mdx` files instead of `.md` for better React component compatibility
- Prefer HTML-like formatting over traditional Markdown
- Follow the [Consensys style guide](https://docs-template.consensys.net/contribute/style-guide)
- Maintain consistent formatting with existing documentation

#### For Ecosystem Contributors

If you're contributing documentation about your project in the Linea ecosystem:

- Focus on informative content over marketing
- Keep information up-to-date and accurate
- Maintain external links and documentation
- Return to update content as your project evolves

## Running locally

You will need to have Node.js installed to run the live previews of the docs locally.

It is highly recommended that you use a tool like [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)
to manage Node.js versions on your machine.

### Installing recommended Node.js version with `nvm`

1. Follow the above instructions to install `nvm` on your machine, or go [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).
2. Go to the root folder of this project in your terminal.
3. Run `nvm install` followed by `nvm use`. This will install the version specified by this project in the `.nvmrc` file.

### Running this project

1. Navigate to root folder of the project after installing Node.js
2. Run the following in sequence, which only needs to be done once:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. To preview and for every time afterwards:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

### Build

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static
contents hosting service.

To run the local build you created, run:

   ```bash
   npm run serve
   ```

### Check spelling and style

This repository includes multiple linters, which you can think of as spell-checks that also inspect
code formatting and standards, and a lot more. It's possible that you might use an unrecognized word,
style your Markdown incorrectly, or otherwise format your content in a way that conflicts with
style guides.

The main linter, Vale, is run through Github Actions and checks spelling, formatting, and adherence to
various style guides. Please pay attention to its suggestions and error warnings in the check that
runs on your PR. These errors will not prevent your PR from building, but you should address them
nevertheless.

See our [guidance on using Vale](https://docs-template.consensys.net/contribute/run-vale) for more
information.

You can run other linters for code style (CSS, JavaScript) and link formatting any time with the
command `npm run lint`.

## Adding images to articles

### Add image files

Any images for articles should be added to the `/static/img/` directory. Here, the `/img` folder
structure mirrors that of the docs, and images are stored in the corresponding subdirectory. If
you have added a _new_ article in `/docs`, create the new subdirectory in `/img` according to this
structure.

#### Format image files

Use the following JSX formatting to add an image into an article:

```
<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-medium">
      <img
        src="/img/path-to-file/image.png"
        alt="alt text here"
      />
  </div>
</div>
```

To adjust the display size of the image, adjust the size class to one of the following:

`img-xsmall`, `img-small`, `img-medium`, `img-large`

Adhere to using these predefined sizings where possible.

#### Format svg files

Use the following formatting for svg files. Place the import statement at the top of the file,
beneath the front matter.

```
import MySVGGraphic from "/img/path-to-file/image.svg";
```
```
<div className="img-large">
  <MySVGGraphic />
</div>
```

As outlined above, you can adjust the display size of the svg by changing the class applied.

### Social cards

A social card for any new article(s) will be generated and applied when the site builds, so there
is no need to manually create or add one.
