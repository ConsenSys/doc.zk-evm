# Report an issue

If during testing, you encounter any issues, please contact zkevm-feedback@consensys.net to report an issue. The more information you provide the better: transaction ID, screenshots, and detailed steps taken to reproduce the issue will help resolve the issues quicker.
You can also post your issue in the **zkevm-rollup** channel in the [ConsenSys Discord](https://discord.com/invite/consensys) if you do not prefer to use email.
