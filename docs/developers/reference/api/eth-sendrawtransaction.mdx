# `eth_sendRawTransaction`

:::note

`eth_sendRawTransaction` is functionally very similar to the [Ethereum Mainnet equivalent](https://docs.infura.io/api/networks/ethereum/json-rpc-methods/eth_sendrawtransaction). 

The difference lies in the [error responses](#errors). On Linea, `eth_sendRawTransaction` has some 
unique error responses.

:::

Submits a pre-signed and serialized transaction and returns the transaction hash if successful.

On Linea, this endpoint can be particularly useful for preventing transactions from failing as a 
result of exceeding the sequencer's line limit per block. An error message is returned if the line
count check fails, indicating that the transaction will fail.

The line limit is a threshold for how much transaction data can effectively be added to a single
proof; too many lines of data, and the prover is unable to add the transaction to the proof within
the time limit. A line count check is therefore imposed on every transaction to ensure 
transactions are successful, and able to be added to a proof.

## Parameters

`transaction data`: [Required] The signed transaction data.

## Returns

The 32-byte transaction hash, or the zero hash if the transaction is not yet available.

## Errors

### Gas price too low

The error `Gas price too low` is thrown when the transaction's gas is too low; specifically, the 
offered gas does not create enough of a buffer to ensure that Linea can cover the costs of 
finalizing the transaction on L1.

### Transaction line count above limit

This error will display in the format:
`Transaction line count for module [A] is above the limit [B]`

Where the module, `[A]`, is the data contained in your raw transaction, and the limit `[B]` is 
the line count limit.
