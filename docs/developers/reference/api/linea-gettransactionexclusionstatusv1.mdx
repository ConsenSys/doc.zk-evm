# `linea_getTransactionExclusionStatusV1`

:::info Only available on request

This API method is only available via Infura endpoints on request. If you would like to have it 
made available, please get in touch with technical support via the "Contact" button on our 
[support page](https://support.linea.build/).

:::

Queries a temporary database maintained by the transaction exclusion API service to check if a 
transaction  was rejected for exceeding data line limits that would prevent the prover from 
generating a proof for the block. The database is updated by a parallel write API endpoint called 
by the sequencer, edge nodes, or RPC nodes.

If the transaction was rejected, the API call will be successful and provide the reason. 

Transactions that were not rejected for this reason will return `null` as the `result`. 

:::warning
Transaction rejection can only be checked within seven days of the transaction attempt.
:::

## Parameters

`txHash`: [Required] The hash of the subject transaction.

## Returns

- `txHash`: The hash of the subject transaction. 
- `from`: The public address of the account that sent the transaction. 
- `nonce`: The transaction nonce, hexadecimal. 
- `txRejectionStage`: A string detailing the point at which the transaction was rejected. One of:
    - `SEQUENCER`: Rejected by the sequencer.
    - `RPC`: Rejected by an RPC node (e.g. `https://rpc.linea.build`).
    - `P2P`: Rejected by a P2P-connected node (e.g. an edge node). 
- `reasonMessage`: Explains why the transaction was rejected. 
- `blockNumber`: The block that the transaction was rejected from, in hexadecimal format. Only 
returned for transactions rejected by the sequencer. 
- `timestamp`: Time of rejection, in ISO 8601 format.

            "params": ["0x526e56101cf39c1e717cef9cedf6fdddb42684711abda35bae51136dbb350ad7"]

### Response

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="JSON">
        ```json
        {
            "jsonrpc": "2.0",
            "id": "1",
            "result": {
                "txHash": "0x526e56101cf39c1e717cef9cedf6fdddb42684711abda35bae51136dbb350ad7",
                "from": "0x4d144d7b9c96b26361d6ac74dd1d8267edca4fc2",
                "nonce": "0x64",
                "txRejectionStage": "SEQUENCER",
                "reasonMessage": "Transaction line count for module ADD=402 is above the limit 70",
                "blockNumber": "0x3039",
                "timestamp": "2024-08-22T09:18:51Z"
            }
        }
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note

This example is purely representative; the database only retains transaction data for seven days, so
you will be unable to reproduce this response with the transaction in the above example.

:::

If the transaction was not rejected for exceeding line limits, the transaction will not be found 
in the database, and a `null` result is returned. For example:

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "result": null
}
```
