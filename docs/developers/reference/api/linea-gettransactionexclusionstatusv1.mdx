# `linea_getTransactionExclusionStatusV1`

Queries a database maintained by the sequencer to check if a transaction was rejected because it 
exceeded limits that would prevent the prover from generating a proof for the block.

If the transaction was rejected, the API call will be successful and provide the reason. 

Transactions that were not rejected for this reason will return a `Rejected transaction not available` 
error. 

:::warning
Transactions older than 24 hours cannot be checked.
:::

## Parameters

`txHash`: [Required] The hash of the subject transaction.

## Returns

- `txHash`: The hash of the subject transaction. 
- `from`: The public address of the account that sent the transaction. 
- `nonce`: The transaction nonce, hexadecimal. 
- `txRejectionStage`: A string detailing the point at which the transaction was rejected. One of:
    - `SEQUENCER`: Rejected by the sequencer.
    - `RPC`: Rejected by an RPC node (e.g. `https://rpc.linea.build`).
    - `P2P`: Rejected by a P2P-connected node (e.g. an edge node). 
- `reasonMessage`: Explains why the transaction was rejected. 
- `blockNumber`: The block that the transaction was rejected from, in hexadecimal format. Only 
returned for transactions rejected by the sequencer. 
- `timestamp`: Time of rejection, in ISO8601 format.
