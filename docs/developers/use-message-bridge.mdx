# Linea message bridge

Use the Linea message bridge to bridge funds or arbitrary messages between Goerli and Linea to enable your use case.

:::tip

If you are bridging funds, we recommend using our bridge [here](../use-linea/bridge-funds.md).

## Overview

The Linea message bridge operates using the following patterns:

### L1 to L2

1. The developer sends a transaction to the L1 bridge contract (implementing the [`IBridge.sol`](#ibridgesol) interface) using the `dispatchMessage` method.
1. The L1 bridge contract emits a `MessageDispatched` event.
1. The rollup `relayer` catches the event and sends an L2 transaction to the L2 bridge contract using the `deliverMessage` function.
1. The L2 contract calls the contract defined in the `to` field. The L2 contract should authenticate the call by calling the `sender()` method on the L2 bridge upon reception of the `deliverMessage` call, and verify that this corresponds to a known L1 address.
1. The L1 bridge contract verifies the message execution, and emits an event `MessageConfirmed`, once the next L2 block is finalized and the ZK proof is verified.
1. Otherwise, the developer can drop a message after the `deadline`, effectively reimbursing the value that was sent.

### L2 to L1

The four first steps are identical to [L1 to L2](#l1-to-l2) but in the opposite direction.

1. The developer sends a transaction to the L2 bridge contract (implementing the [`IBridge.sol`](#ibridgesol) interface) using the `dispatchMessage` method.
1. The L2 bridge contract emits a `MessageDispatched` event.
1. The rollup `relayer` catches the event and sends an L1 transaction to the L1 bridge contract using the `deliverMessage` function.
1. The L1 contract calls the contract defined in the `to` field. The L1 contract should authenticate the call by calling the `sender()` method on the L1 bridge upon reception of the `deliverMessage` call, and verify that this corresponds to a known L1 address.
1. The `relayer` embeds messages as a parameter when finalizing the block and verifying the ZK proof.

### Deployed contract addresses

The contracts are deployed at the following addresses:

- The L1 bridge, implementing the `IBridge.sol` and `IL1Bridge.sol` interfaces, is located at [`0xE87d317eB8dcc9afE24d9f63D6C760e52Bc18A40`](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xe87d317eb8dcc9afe24d9f63d6c760e52bc18a40).
- The L2 bridge, implementing the `IBridge.sol` interface, is located at [`0xA59477f7742Ba7d51bb1E487a8540aB339d6801d`](https://explorer.goerli.linea.build/address/0xA59477f7742Ba7d51bb1E487a8540aB339d6801d).
