# Estimate transaction costs

## How gas works on Linea

Linea supports the [Ethereum EIP-1559 gas price model](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/gas):
```
total fee = units of gas used * (base fee + priority fee)
```

Linea fundamentally works exactly the same as Ethereum. The one difference is that **the base fee 
is constant at 7 wei.** Blocks created by Linea use up to 24 million gas (less than 50% of the 
maximum Linea block size of 61 million gas), and the fee decreases by 12.5% per block, effectively 
keeping it at a stable 7 wei.

The gas cost to submit your transaction and include it on Ethereum involves the following fee 
components:

- **Layer 2 cost**: The execution fee; the cost of including your transaction on the Linea 
  sequencer, and calculated using a similar formula to Ethereum (as described above). 
- **Layer 1 cost**: The cost of publishing your L2 transaction on Ethereum, which varies 
  based on the blob fee market.

These two resource costs are abstracted by the rollup and covered by the recommended L2 gas price
and gas used.

`linea_estimateGas` is the recommended method for estimating gas on Linea. See our 
[reference page](../../reference/api/linea-estimategas.mdx) for more information. 

Linea also supports [`eth_estimateGas`](https://docs.infura.io/api/networks/linea/json-rpc-methods/eth_estimategas),
[`eth_gasPrice`](https://docs.infura.io/api/networks/linea/json-rpc-methods/eth_gasprice), and
[`eth_feeHistory`](https://docs.infura.io/api/networks/linea/json-rpc-methods/eth_feehistory).

You can use `eth_gasPrice` or `eth_feeHistory` to get the gas price, in wei, and you can use 
`eth_estimateGas` to find out how many units of gas a specific transaction will need. 

## [`linea_estimateGas`](../../reference/api/linea-estimategas.mdx)

`linea_estimateGas` is the recommended method for estimating gas on Linea. It returns `gasLimit`, 
`baseFeePerGas`, and `priorityFeePerGas`, and therefore provides a more precise gas estimate than 
the alternatives.

It can also help prevent transactions from being rejected due to exceeding [module limits](../../../architecture/stack/trace-expansion-proving/prover-limits.mdx).
