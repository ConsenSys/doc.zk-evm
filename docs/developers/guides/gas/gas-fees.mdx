# Estimate transaction costs

## How gas works on Linea

Linea supports the [Ethereum EIP-1559 gas price model](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/gas):
```
total fee = units of gas used * (base fee + priority fee)
```

Linea fundamentally works exactly the same as Ethereum. The one difference is that **the base fee 
is constant at 7 wei.** Blocks created by Linea use up to 24 million gas (less than 50% of the 
maximum Linea block size of 61 million gas), and the fee decreases by 12.5% per block, effectively 
keeping it at a stable 7 wei.

The gas cost to submit your transaction and include it on Ethereum involves the following fee 
components:

- **Layer 2 cost**: The execution fee; the cost of including your transaction on the Linea 
  sequencer, and calculated using a similar formula to Ethereum (as described above). 
- **Layer 1 cost**: The cost of publishing your L2 transaction on Ethereum, which varies 
  based on the blob fee market.

These two resource costs are abstracted by the rollup and covered by the recommended L2 gas price
and gas used.

`linea_estimateGas` is the recommended method for estimating gas on Linea. See our 
[reference page](../../reference/api/linea-estimategas.mdx) for more information. 

Linea also supports [`eth_estimateGas`](https://docs.infura.io/api/networks/linea/json-rpc-methods/eth_estimategas),
[`eth_gasPrice`](https://docs.infura.io/api/networks/linea/json-rpc-methods/eth_gasprice), and
[`eth_feeHistory`](https://docs.infura.io/api/networks/linea/json-rpc-methods/eth_feehistory).

You can use `eth_gasPrice` or `eth_feeHistory` to get the gas price, in wei, and you can use 
`eth_estimateGas` to find out how many units of gas a specific transaction will need. 

## [`linea_estimateGas`](../../reference/api/linea-estimategas.mdx)

`linea_estimateGas` is the recommended method for estimating gas on Linea. It returns `gasLimit`, 
`baseFeePerGas`, and `priorityFeePerGas`, and therefore provides a more precise gas estimate than 
the alternatives.

It can also help prevent transactions from being rejected due to exceeding [module limits](../../../architecture/stack/trace-expansion-proving/prover-limits.mdx).

See the [reference page](../../reference/api/linea-estimategas.mdx) for usage.

## `eth_gasPrice`

### Parameters

None.

### Returns

A hexadecimal equivalent of an integer representing the current gas price in wei.

    curl https://rpc.sepolia.linea.build \
       -X POST \

#### Response

    ```json
    {
      "jsonrpc":"2.0",
      "id":1,

    }
    ```

## `eth_feeHistory`

### Parameters 

- `blockCount`: (integer) Number of blocks in the requested range. Between 1 and 1024 blocks can be 
  requested in a single query. If blocks in the specified block range are not available, then only the 
  fee history for available blocks is returned.
- `newestBlock`: (string) Integer representing the highest number block of the requested range, or 
  one of the string tags `latest`, `earliest`, or `pending`.
- `array` of `integers`: (optional) A monotonically increasing list of percentile values to sample 
  from each block's effective priority fees per gas in ascending order, weighted by gas used.

### Returns 

- `oldestBlock`: Lowest number block of the returned range expressed as a hexadecimal number.
- `baseFeePerGas`: An array of block base fees per gas, including an extra block value. The extra 
  value is the next block after the newest block in the returned range. Returns zeroes for blocks 
  created before EIP-1559.
- `gasUsedRatio`: An array of block gas used ratios. These are calculated as the ratio of `gasUsed` 
  and `gasLimit`.
- `reward`: An array of effective priority fee per gas data points from a single block. All zeroes 
  are returned if the block is empty.

## `eth_estimateGas`

### Parameters

- `TRANSACTION CALL OBJECT` [required]
  - `from`: [optional] 20 Bytes - The address the transaction is sent from.
  - `to`: 20 Bytes - The address the transaction is directed to.
  - `gas`: [optional] Hexadecimal value of the gas provided for the transaction execution. `eth_estimateGas` consumes zero gas, but this parameter may be needed by some executions.
  - `gasPrice`: [optional] Hexadecimal value of the gas price used for each paid gas.
  - `maxPriorityFeePerGas`: [optional] Maximum fee, in wei, the sender is willing to pay per gas above the base fee. 
  - `maxFeePerGas`: [optional] Maximum total fee (base fee + priority fee), in wei, the sender is willing to pay per gas. 
  - `value`: [optional] Hexadecimal value of the value sent with this transaction.
  - `data`: [optional] Hash of the method signature and encoded parameters. See the [Ethereum contract ABI specification](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/abi-spec.html).
  - `block number`: [required] A string representing a block number, or one of the string tags `latest`, `earliest`, `pending`, `safe`, or `finalized`. See the [default block parameter](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#default-block).

### Returns

A hexadecimal of the estimate of the gas required for the given transaction.
