# Dynamic NFTs

Data on Irys is permanent and immutable, but you use [Irys' mutable references](https://docs.irys.xyz/developer-docs/mutable-references) to simulate mutability and create dynamic NFTs that evolve based on onchain or offchain actions.

With mutable references, you create a single, static URL that is linked to a series of transactions. You can add a new transaction to the series at any time, and the URL will always resolve to the most recent transaction.

## About

In this guide, you will create a dynamic NFT using Irys' mutable references. Dynamic NFTs are NFTs whose metadata evolves over time. They are commonly used in:

- Gaming projects where in-game assets evolve as players progress.
- Loyalty programs where NFTs evolve as users accumulate points.

This tutorial focuses on creating a SuperMon NFT that could evolve during gameplay. The NFT starts with a basic appearance and can be "upgraded" twice. We will use the [Irys CLI](/developers/tooling/permanent-data/irys/irys-quickstart#irys-cli) to "mutate" the metadata, simulating the automatic changes that would occur through player interactions in an actual game.

## Mutable references

Mutable references are a way to simulate "mutability".

1. You start by creating a single static URL that is tied to a chain of transactions:

```js
const irys = await getIrys();
const receiptOne = await irys.upload("First TX");
console.log(`TX 1 uploaded https://gateway.irys.xyz/mutable/${receiptOne.id}`);
```

1. Then you update the "chain" by posting a second transaction (from the same wallet) tagged with the original transaction's ID:

```js
const tags = [{ name: "Root-TX", value: receiptOne.id }];
const receiptTwo = await irys.upload("Second TX", { tags });
console.log(`TX 2 uploaded https://gateway.irys.xyz/mutable/${receiptOne.id}`);
```

## Smart contract

We're building an NFT, which means we need a smart contract. Here's a simple one you can use to mint the NFT we'll create.

```solidity filename="SuperMon.sol"
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

// Import OpenZeppelin's ERC721 and ERC721URIStorage contracts
// These URLs are compatible with Remix IDE
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721URIStorage.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract SuperMon is ERC721URIStorage {
    uint256 private _tokenIdCounter;

    // No arguments in the constructor, the owner will be the contract deployer
    constructor() ERC721("SuperMon", "SMON") {
        _tokenIdCounter = 0;
    }

    // Mint function to create a new NFT
    function mint(address to, string memory uri) public {
        uint256 tokenId = _tokenIdCounter;
        _tokenIdCounter += 1;
        _safeMint(to, tokenId);
        _setTokenURI(tokenId, uri);
    }
}

```

[Deploy the smart contract using Remix](/developers/quickstart/deploy-smart-contract/remix), or [any other environment](https://docs.linea.build/developers/quickstart/deploy-smart-contract).

## Irys CLI

We'll use the Irys CLI to upload images and metadata.

### Installing the CLI

Install the Irys CLI globally using the -g flag. Depending on your setup, you may or may not need to use sudo.

```console
npm i -g @irys/sdk
sudo npm i -g @irys/sdk
```

### Using private keys

When executing CLI commands involving funding nodes or signing transactions, you must provide a private key.

Use the -w flag to specify a private key along with the -t flag to indicate the token you'll use.

```console
irys -w <linea-private-key> -t linea-eth
```

## Uploading the images

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    flexDirection: "row",
    gap: "0.5rem",
    width: "100%",
    maxWidth: "83.333333%",
  }}>
  <img
    style={{
      border: "1px solid #FEF4EE",
      borderRadius: "0.75rem",
      marginTop: "1.25rem",
      width: "33.333333%",
    }}
    src="/img/docs/build-on-linea/tooling/permanent-data/irys/image-level-1.png"
    alt="Image Level 1"
  />
  <img
    style={{
      border: "1px solid #FEF4EE",
      borderRadius: "0.75rem",
      marginTop: "1.25rem",
      width: "33.333333%",
    }}
    src="/img/docs/build-on-linea/tooling/permanent-data/irys/image-level-2.png"
    alt="Image Level 2"
  />
  <img
    style={{
      border: "1px solid #FEF4EE",
      borderRadius: "0.75rem",
      marginTop: "1.25rem",
      width: "33.333333%",
    }}
    src="/img/docs/build-on-linea/tooling/permanent-data/irys/image-level-3.png"
    alt="Image Level 3"
  />
</div>

Right-click on each of the above images and save them on your local drive.

Next, fund the Irys Devnet node with 0.1 [Linea Sepolia ETH](https://www.infura.io/faucet/linea) to pay for your uploads.

> In all of these CLI examples, make sure to replace the value of the `-w` parameter with your own private key.

```console
irys fund 100000000000000000 \
  -n devnet \
  -t linea-eth \
  -w 6dd5e....54a120201cb6a \
  --provider-url https://rpc.sepolia.linea.build
```

> The `fund` command accepts a value in atomic units, 0.1 ETH is equal to 100000000000000000 in atomic units.

Next, use the Irys CLI to upload each of the images to the Irys Devnet.

```console
irys upload image-level-1.png \
  -n devnet \
  -t linea-eth \
  -w 6dd5e....54a120201cb6a \
  --provider-url https://rpc.sepolia.linea.build

irys upload image-level-2.png \
  -n devnet \
  -t linea-eth \
  -w 6dd5e....54a120201cb6a \
  --provider-url https://rpc.sepolia.linea.build

irys upload image-level-3.png \
  -n devnet \
  -t linea-eth \
  -w 6dd5e....54a120201cb6a \
  --provider-url https://rpc.sepolia.linea.build
```

## Uploading the metadata

Create three metadata files similar to the ones below. Make sure to change the value of the image field to match the URLs generated in the previous step.

```jason filename="metadata-level-1.json"
{
  "name": "SuperMon",
  "symbol": "SMON",
  "image": "https://gateway.irys.xyz/QH3rksVhbFg5L9vvjGzb4POUibCEG-TGPInmofp-O-o",
  "description": "Super dooper, changing shapes, changing power",
  "attributes": [
    {
      "trait_type": "supermon-level",
      "value": "1"
    }
  ]
}
```

```jason filename="metadata-level-2.json"
{
  "name": "SuperMon",
  "symbol": "SMON",
  "image": "https://gateway.irys.xyz/QH3rksVhbFg5L9vvjGzb4POUibCEG-TGPInmofp-O-o",
  "description": "Super dooper, changing shapes, changing power",
  "attributes": [
    {
      "trait_type": "supermon-level",
      "value": "2"
    }
  ]

}
```

```jason filename="metadata-level-3.json"
{
  "name": "SuperMon",
  "symbol": "SMON",
  "image": "https://gateway.irys.xyz/QH3rksVhbFg5L9vvjGzb4POUibCEG-TGPInmofp-O-o",
  "description": "Super dooper, changing shapes, changing power",
  "attributes": [
    {
      "trait_type": "supermon-level",
      "value": "3"
    }
  ]

}
```

And upload **just the first file** using the Irys CLI.

```console
irys upload metadata-level-1.json \
  -n devnet \
  -t linea-eth \
  -w 6dd5e....54a120201cb6a \
  --provider-url https://rpc.sepolia.linea.build
```

The CLI will return a URL similar to `https://gateway.irys.xyz/NDtKvjlmZL2iXUPmX6P-BuvtnvAEFkUiQWG8ToyK5FM`. To convert that to a mutable references URL, interpolate it by adding `/mutable/` after the domain and before the transaction ID.

Your final URL will be similar to `https://gateway.irys.xyz/mutable/NDtKvjlmZL2iXUPmX6P-BuvtnvAEFkUiQWG8ToyK5FM`.

## Minting the NFT

To mint your NFT in Remix:

1. Return to Remix.
2. Under "Deployed Contracts", locate your contract and expand it to see its functions.
3. Under the `Mint` function, enter the wallet address you want to mint the NFT to and the metadata URL (e.g. `https://gateway.irys.xyz/mutable/NDtKvjlmZL2iXUPmX6P-BuvtnvAEFkUiQWG8ToyK5FM`) from the previous step.
4. Click Transact.

  src="/img/docs/build-on-linea/tooling/permanent-data/irys/open-sea-mockup.jpg"
/>

You can now view the NFT on the [Opensea Testnet](https://testnets.opensea.io/account).

## Mutating the metadata

To now "mutate" the NFT, upload a new version of the metadata tagging it as having a `Root-TX` equal to the transaction ID of your first transaction. In my example, I pass the value of `NDtKvjlmZL2iXUPmX6P-BuvtnvAEFkUiQWG8ToyK5FM`, however make sure to change this to match your unique transaction ID.

```console
irys upload metadata-level-2.json \
  -n devnet \
  -t linea-eth \
  -w 6dd5e....54a120201cb6a \
  --tags Root-TX NDtKvjlmZL2iXUPmX6P-BuvtnvAEFkUiQWG8ToyK5FM \
  --provider-url https://rpc.sepolia.linea.build
```

Return to Opensea and request that it refresh your metadata.

<img
  className="border border-[#FEF4EE] rounded-xl mt-5 lg:w-5/6 w-full"
  src="/img/docs/build-on-linea/tooling/permanent-data/irys/refresh-metadata.png"
/>

Give it a few minutes and your updated NFT should be visible.

## Free metadata uploads

This tutorial uses the Irys Devnet where uploads are kept for ~60 days and are paid for with free faucet currencies. When deploying production projects, you'll use Irys' mainnet where uploads are permanent.

Uploads of less than 100 KiB are free on Irys, which is more than enough for most metadata files. This means projects can let users "evolve" their NFTs without having to pay gas fees.

## Caching

Wallets and NFT websites typically cache metadata to optimize performance, this can affect the visibility of updates to dynamic NFTs. While OpenSea offers a feature for users to manually request metadata refreshes, not all platforms provide this level of control. When building dynamic NFT projects, make sure to thoroughly test and understand the implications of caching on your platform.
