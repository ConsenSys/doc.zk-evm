# Run the Linea stack

:::info

The Linea stack is currently available only for local testing. This includes a local version of the
base layer (Hyperledger Besu) and the Linea stack itself.
 
:::

Run the the entire Linea stack to get working versions of:

- **Sequencer**: Responsible for ordering, building, and executing blocks.
- **State manager**: Manages the L2 network and account states.
- **Coordinator**: Coordinates the steps to create zk proofs and ensures their persistence on the
    L1 Ethereum network. It specifically handles batch conflation, blob creation, and aggregation.
- **Traces API**: Provides trace counts and generates conflated trace files for zk proof creation.
- **Provers**: Generates three types of zk-SNARK proofs: execution, compression, and aggregation, it dynamically
    adjusts its instances based on the volume of proof requests.

Refer to the [Linea architecture documentation](../../../../architecture/index.mdx) for more information
about the Linea stack components.
