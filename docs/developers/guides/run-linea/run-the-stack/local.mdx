# Run locally

## Prerequisites

### Hardware requirements

TODO

### Software requirements

The following installed:

- [Node.js v18](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
- [Docker v24](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose v2.19 or later](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Make v3.81 or later](https://www.npmjs.com/package/make)
- [Pnpm >=v9.0.6](https://pnpm.io/installation)

## Run the Linea stack

### 1. Clone the repository

Clone the Linea repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Consensys/linea-monorepo.git
```

### 2. Install the dependencies

Change to the root of the directory and install the project dependencies:

```bash
cd linea-monorepo
```

```bash
pnpm i
```

### 3. Start the Linea stack

Start the network stack, this will also compile and deploy the required rollup contracts:

```bash
make fresh-start-all
```

You now have a local developer instance of the entire Linea network which includes components such as
the sequencer, prover, coordinator, and a local L1 settlement layer. You can view the components in
Docker Desktop.

You can [connect your MetaMask wallet](https://support.metamask.io/networks-and-sidechains/managing-networks/how-to-add-a-custom-network-rpc/#adding-a-network-manually)
to the required chain and [import the deployment account](https://support.metamask.io/managing-my-wallet/accounts-and-addresses/how-to-import-an-account/#importing-using-a-private-key)
to access the test tokens.

## Stop the Linea stack

You can stop and start the the Docker containers in Docker Desktop. However, constant stopping and
starting can lead to network or state issues.

Once stopped, you can clean your environment using the following commands:

:::note
This will permanently remove all docker images, containers and docker volumes and any data saved it them.
:::

```bash
make clean-environment
```
```bash
docker system prune --volumes
```
