# Run Linea

You can run the entire Linea stack or a Linea node. Choosing between running the entire Linea stack
and a Linea node depends on your specific needs and the environment you're working in.

## When to run the Linea stack

:::info
Currently, the Linea stack is available for local deployments only.
:::

The Linea stack incorporates the base layer (L1) and the Linea stack itself. This setup is suited for
developers who are in the process of developing or testing applications on the Linea L2 network.
By running the entire Linea stack locally, developers benefit from a controlled environment that provides
direct access to the blockchain's capabilities without connecting to Sepolia or the Ethereum Mainnet.

## When to run a Linea node

Running a Linea node enables users to call Linea JSON RPC API methods and submit transactions to the
mempool independently, without depending on external RPC providers. This setup ensures a "trusted" local
view of the Linea blockchain state, up until transactions or their containing blocks are finalized on Layer 1 (L1).
