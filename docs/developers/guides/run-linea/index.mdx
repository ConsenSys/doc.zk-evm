# Run Linea

You can run the entire Linea stack or a Linea node. Choosing between running the entire Linea stack
and a Linea node depends on your specific needs and the environment you're working in.

## When to run the Linea stack

:::info
Currently, the Linea stack is available for local deployments only.
:::

Run the Linea stack locally if you want to develop or test applications on Linea without connecting
to Sepolia or Ethereum Mainnet.

The Linea stack incorporates the base layer (L1) and the Linea stack itself.
By running the entire Linea stack locally, developers benefit from a controlled environment that provides
direct access to the blockchain's capabilities.

## When to run a Linea node

Run a Linea node if you want a local view of the Linea blockchain state.
A node enables users to call Linea JSON RPC API methods and submit transactions to the
mempool independently, without depending on external RPC providers.
