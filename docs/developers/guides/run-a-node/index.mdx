# Run a Linea node

This section guides you through running a Linea node using various clients.

:::info important
While Linea supports multiple clients, only Linea Besu currently allows you to use Linea-specific
features, such as accessing [Linea methods](../../reference/api/index.mdx) (for example, `linea_estimateGas`)
or calling methods using the `finalized` tag.

Linea Besu is recommemended for infrastructure providers and operators who intend to run a Linea
node, whether for offering node services to others or for using Linea with a personal, private RPC endpoint.
:::

The vanilla client implementations (Besu, Geth, Erigon, etc) allow you to have a local copy of the
Linea blockchain, also known as a "follower" node. This view of the state is "trusted" until the
transaction, or the block that transaction is in, has been finalized on L1.

The following table lists the clients covered in this guide, and whether they provide access to Linea-specific
features.

| Name                           | Description                                                                                                                                                 | Run Linea-specific features? |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| [Besu](./besu.mdx)             | An Java-based open-source Ethereum client that can be extended using plugins.                                                                               | ❌                     |
| [Linea Besu](./linea-besu.mdx) | A modified version of Besu with plugins that implement Linea-specific features, such as the [Linea sequencer](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-sequencer) | ✔️                      |
| [Erigon](./erigon.mdx)         | A client implementation focused on performance and saving disk space, written in Go.                                                                        | ❌                     |
| [Geth](./geth.mdx)             | The most widely used open-source Ethereum client, written in Go.                                                                                            | ❌                     |


There are no financial incentives for running a Linea node, and there is currently no option to
vote on blocks as part of the consensus mechanism or
[fork-choice](https://eth2book.info/capella/part3/forkchoice/#whats-a-fork-choice) like on Ethereum.
