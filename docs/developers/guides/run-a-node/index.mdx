# Run a Linea node

There are no financial incentives for running a Linea node, but it does allow you to:

- Call the Linea JSON RPC API methods and submit transactions to the mempool without relying on an 
RPC provider. Note that using [Linea-specific API methods](../../reference/api/index.mdx) such as 
`linea_estimateGas` and the `finalized` tag require using Linea Besu with the necessary plugins 
enabled. Configuring your node to run with these plugins is covered in our guides. 
- Have a local copy of the Linea blockchain, also known as a "follower" node. This view of the 
state is "trusted" until the transaction, or the block that transaction is in, has been finalized 
on L1.

:::note

There is currently no option to vote on blocks as part of the consensus mechanism or [fork-choice](https://eth2book.info/capella/part3/forkchoice/#whats-a-fork-choice) 
like on Ethereum.
