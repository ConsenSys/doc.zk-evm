You can use Docker to run [Besu](https://besu.hyperledger.org/), [Linea Besu](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-besu-package/tree/main),
 or [Geth](https://geth.ethereum.org/) as a Linea node on Mainnet or Linea Sepolia.

## Prerequisites

Download and install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).


## Run a Linea Besu node 

We recommend using Linea Besu over standard Besu if you intend to run a node to interact 
with the blockchain, rather than just following it. Linea Besu is an implementation of the Besu
client that extends its functionality using plugins adapted specifically for Linea, such as the
[Linea Sequencer plugin](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-sequencer).

Plugins enable full functionality for the node. For example,
Linea-specific API endpoints like `linea_estimateGas` require the `linea-sequencer` plugin.
Plugins are installed with the `advanced` profile in [step 3](#step-3-select-a-profile).

This guide is for infrastructure providers and operators who intend to run a Linea node. This is 
relevant to you if:
- You are responsible for operating nodes as a service for others to use
- You want to use Linea with a personal, private RPC endpoint.

### Step 1. Download the relevant `docker-compose.yaml` file

Access the [`/docker` directory](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-besu-package/tree/main/docker) 
in the Linea Besu repository. There are several `.yaml` files here corresponding to Besu profiles. 
Each profile enables you to run a node with different Linea Besu plugin configurations depending on
your use case.

<Tabs groupId="networks" className="my-tabs">
  <TabItem value="mainnet" label="Mainnet">
    Download the appropriate `.yaml` file for your use case:
    - `basic-mainnet`: Creates a basic follower node on Linea Mainnet with no plugins enabled.
    - `advanced-mainnet`: Creates an advanced node on Linea Mainnet with plugins that enable support 
    for `linea_estimateGas` and the `finalized` block parameter tag.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Linea Sepolia" label="Linea Sepolia">
    Download the appropriate `.yaml` file for your use case:
    - `basic-testnet`: Creates a basic follower node on Linea Sepolia with no plugins enabled.
    - `advanced-testnet`: Creates an advanced node on Linea Sepolia with plugins that enable support 
    for `linea_estimateGas` and the `finalized` block parameter tag.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Step 2. Update IP address

In the `.yaml` file you downloaded, adjust the `--p2p-host` command with your public IP address:

```yaml
--p2p-host=103.10.10.10
```

You can use [this page](https://www.whatismyip.com/) to find your public IP address.

### Step 3. Configure your L1 RPC endpoint

If you're using an `advanced` profile, insert your preferred L1 RPC endpoint in the 
`docker-compose.yaml` file:

```yaml
--plugin-linea-l1-rpc-endpoint=YOUR_L1_RPC_ENDPOINT
```

If you only intend to run a `basic` profile, go straight to the next step.

### Step 4. Start the Linea Besu node

<Tabs groupId="networks" className="my-tabs">
  <TabItem value="mainnet" label="Mainnet">
    In a terminal, navigate to your `.yaml` file's directory. Then start the node by running 
    `docker compose`: 

    ```bash
    docker compose -f ./your-file-path/docker-compose-advanced-mainnet.yaml up
    ```

    Alternatively, you can run a node without downloading a `.yaml` file with a `docker run` command. 
    For example:

    ```bash
    docker run -e BESU_PROFILE=advanced-mainnet consensys/linea-besu-package:latest
    ```

    Adjust the `BESU_PROFILE` to match one of the profiles listed in step 1. 
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Linea Sepolia" label="Linea Sepolia">
      In a terminal, navigate to your `.yaml` file's directory. Then start the node by running 
      `docker compose`: 

      ```bash
      docker compose -f ./your-file-path/docker-compose-advanced-testnet.yaml up
      ```

      Alternatively, you can run a node without downloading a `.yaml` file with a `docker run` command. 
      For example:

      ```bash
      docker run -e BESU_PROFILE=advanced-testnet consensys/linea-besu-package:latest
      ```

      Adjust the `BESU_PROFILE` to match one of the profiles listed in step 1. 
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>




## Confirm the node is running

You can call the JSON-RPC API methods to confirm the node is running. For example, call
[`eth_syncing`](https://besu.hyperledger.org/public-networks/reference/api#eth_syncing) to return the synchronization status.
For example the starting, current, and highest block, or `false` if not synchronizing (or if the head of the chain has been reached).

```bash

curl localhost:8545 \
        -X POST \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_syncing","params":[],"id":1}'

```

You should get a result similar to:

```bash
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "startingBlock": "0x0",
    "currentBlock": "0x5d228",
    "highestBlock": "0x3cedec"
  }
}
```
