You can use Docker to run [Hyperledger Besu](https://besu.hyperledger.org/), [Linea Besu](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-besu-package/tree/main),
 or [Geth](https://geth.ethereum.org/) as a Linea node on Mainnet or Linea Sepolia.

## Prerequisites

Download and install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

## Run a standard Besu node

:::warning Important

The Besu Docker image does not run on Windows.

:::

### Step 1. Download configuration files

Download the configuration files for the relevant network (in ZIP format) and extract them. The configuration
files include the network genesis file, Docker Compose file and Besu configuration file.

<Tabs groupId="networks" className="my-tabs">
  <TabItem value="mainnet" label="Mainnet">
  
  Download the mainnet [`besu-mainnet` ZIP file](pathname:///files/besu/besu-mainnet.zip).

  :::note[enodes]
  You can choose from a range of edge nodes (enodes) for Linea Mainnet. The Besu `.zip` includes a
  config file named `config-snap-mainnet.toml` where enodes are specified. The file uses all enodes
  by default.

  See our [enodes page](./enodes.mdx) for a full list of available enodes.

  <TabItem value="Linea Sepolia" label="Linea Sepolia">
  
  Download the testnet [`besu-sepolia` ZIP file](pathname:///files/besu/besu-sepolia.zip).
  
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Step 2. Update the Docker Compose file

In the `docker-compose.yaml` file, update the `--p2p-host` command to include your public IP address. For example:

```yaml
--p2p-host=103.10.10.10
```

:::tip

You can use [this page](https://www.whatismyip.com/) to find your public IP address.

:::

### Step 3. Start the Besu node

Open a terminal, in the directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` file, run `docker-compose up`. 

It can take up to 20 minutes for the node to find peers. If it takes any longer than that, try restarting the node.

:::tip Troubleshoot peering issues

Refer to the [Besu troubleshooting information](https://besu.hyperledger.org/public-networks/how-to/troubleshoot/peering)
for help if you experience peering issues.

## Run a Linea Besu node

Linea Besu is an implementation of the Hyperledger Besu client that extends its functionality. 

We recommend using Linea Besu over standard Besu if you intend to run a node and use it to interact 
with the blockchain, rather than just following it. 

Linea Besu enables you to use plugins adapted specifically for Linea, such as the [Linea Sequencer 
plugin](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-sequencer).

These plugins are necessary, in different ways, to enable full functionality for the node. 
Linea-specific API endpoints like `linea_estimateGas`, for example, require the `linea-sequencer` 
plugin. You can pick a plugin by selecting a profile in step 1.

This guide is for infrastructure providers and operators who intend to run a Linea node. This is 
relevant to you if:
- You are responsible for operating nodes as a service for others to use
- You want to use Linea with a personal, private RPC endpoint.

### Step 1. Download the relevant `docker-compose.yaml` file

Access the [`/docker` directory](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-besu-package/tree/main/docker) 
in the Linea Besu repository. There are several `.yaml` files here corresponding to Besu profiles. 
Each profile enables you to run a node with different Linea Besu plugin configurations depending on
your use case.

<Tabs groupId="networks" className="my-tabs">
  <TabItem value="mainnet" label="Mainnet">
    Download the appropriate `.yaml` file for your use case:
    - `basic-mainnet`: Creates a basic follower node on Linea Mainnet with no plugins enabled.
    - `advanced-mainnet`: Creates an advanced node on Linea Mainnet with plugins that enable support 
    for `linea_estimateGas` and the `finalized` block parameter tag.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Linea Sepolia" label="Linea Sepolia">
    Download the appropriate `.yaml` file for your use case:
    - `basic-testnet`: Creates a basic follower node on Linea Sepolia with no plugins enabled.
    - `advanced-testnet`: Creates an advanced node on Linea Sepolia with plugins that enable support 
    for `linea_estimateGas` and the `finalized` block parameter tag.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Step 2. Update IP address

In the `.yaml` file you downloaded, adjust the `--p2p-host` command with your public IP address:

```yaml
--p2p-host=103.10.10.10
```

:::tip

You can use [this page](https://www.whatismyip.com/) to find your public IP address.

:::

### Step 3. Configure your L1 RPC endpoint

If you're using an `advanced` profile, insert your preferred L1 RPC endpoint in the 
`docker-compose.yaml` file:

```yaml
--plugin-linea-l1-rpc-endpoint=YOUR_L1_RPC_ENDPOINT
```

If you only intend to run a `basic` profile, go straight to the next step.

### Step 4. Start the Linea Besu node

<Tabs groupId="networks" className="my-tabs">
  <TabItem value="mainnet" label="Mainnet">
    In a terminal, navigate to your `.yaml` file's directory. Then start the node by running 
    `docker compose`: 

    ```bash
    docker compose -f ./your-file-path/docker-compose-advanced-mainnet.yaml up
    ```

    Alternatively, you can run a node without downloading a `.yaml` file with a `docker run` command. 
    For example:

    ```bash
    docker run -e BESU_PROFILE=advanced-mainnet consensys/linea-besu-package:latest
    ```

    Adjust the `BESU_PROFILE` to match one of the profiles listed in step 1. 
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Linea Sepolia" label="Linea Sepolia">
      In a terminal, navigate to your `.yaml` file's directory. Then start the node by running 
      `docker compose`: 

      ```bash
      docker compose -f ./your-file-path/docker-compose-advanced-testnet.yaml up
      ```

      Alternatively, you can run a node without downloading a `.yaml` file with a `docker run` command. 
      For example:

      ```bash
      docker run -e BESU_PROFILE=advanced-testnet consensys/linea-besu-package:latest
      ```

      Adjust the `BESU_PROFILE` to match one of the profiles listed in step 1. 
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Run a Geth node

### Step 1. Download configuration files

Download the configuration files for the relevant network. Ensure that you download the files to the same directory.

<Tabs groupId="networks" className="my-tabs">
  <TabItem value="mainnet" label="Mainnet">
  
  Download the mainnet [`docker-compose.yml`](pathname:///files/geth/mainnet/docker-compose.yml) and [`genesis.json`](pathname:///files/geth/mainnet/genesis.json)
  files.

  :::note[enodes]
  You can choose from a range of edge nodes (enodes) for Linea Mainnet. The Geth `docker-compose.yml`
  file uses all enodes by default. 

  See our [enodes page](./enodes.mdx) for a full list of available enodes.
  :::
  
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Linea Sepolia" label="Linea Sepolia">
  
  Download the Sepolia testnet [`docker-compose.yml`](pathname:///files/geth/sepolia/docker-compose.yml) and [`genesis.json`](pathname:///files/geth/sepolia/genesis.json)
  files.
  
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Step 2. Start the Geth node

Open up a terminal where the both `docker-compose.yml` and `genesis.json` are located (they should be in the same directory)
and run `docker compose up`

The node should now be running and looking for peers to sync.

## Confirm the node is running

You can call the JSON-RPC API methods to confirm the node is running. For example, call
[`eth_syncing`](https://besu.hyperledger.org/public-networks/reference/api#eth_syncing) to return the synchronization status.
For example the starting, current, and highest block, or `false` if not synchronizing (or if the head of the chain has been reached).

```bash

curl localhost:8545 \
        -X POST \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_syncing","params":[],"id":1}'

```

You should get a result similar to:

```bash
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "startingBlock": "0x0",
    "currentBlock": "0x5d228",
    "highestBlock": "0x3cedec"
  }
}
```
