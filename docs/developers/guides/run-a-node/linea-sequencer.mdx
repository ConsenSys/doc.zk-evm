# Install `linea-sequencer`

If you want to run a Linea node and use it to interact with the blockchain, rather than running a 
'follower' node that simply keeps a local copy of the chain, then you will need to install the 
`linea-sequencer` plugin to ensure full functionality.

Specifically, the Linea-specific API methods documented in our [reference section](/developers/reference/api)
will not work properly unless you install and configure `linea-sequencer`.

## Instructions

1. Go to the [`linea-sequencer` repo releases page](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-sequencer/releases)
and download the `.jar` file for the latest release. 

2. In the local Besu runtime directory (where you will run Besu from), create a directory called 
`plugins` and place the `.jar` file there.

3. In the `config-mainnet.toml` file, add `LINEA` to the list of RPC methods:

    ```
    rpc-http-api=["ADMIN","NET","ETH","WEB3","TXPOOL","LINEA"]
    ```

When you run Besu, you will see the `linea-sequencer` plugin registered during startup.
