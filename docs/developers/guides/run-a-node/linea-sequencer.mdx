# Install `linea-sequencer`

If you want to run a Linea node and use it to interact with the blockchain, rather than running a 
'follower' node that simply keeps a local copy of the chain, then you will need to install the 
`linea-sequencer` plugin to ensure full functionality. This plugin only works with Besu.

Specifically, the Linea-specific API methods documented in our [reference section](/developers/reference/api)
will not work unless you install and configure `linea-sequencer`.

## Steps

1. From the [`linea-sequencer` releases page](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-sequencer/releases),
download the `.jar` file for the latest release. 

2. In the local Besu runtime directory (where you will run Besu from), create a directory called 
`plugins` and place the `.jar` file there.

3. In the Besu configuration file (called `config-mainnet.toml` if you downloaded the [file from 
our instructions](pathname:///files/besu/config-mainnet.toml)) file, add `LINEA` to the list of RPC 
methods:

    ```
    rpc-http-api=["ADMIN","NET","ETH","WEB3","TXPOOL","LINEA"]
    ```
    
    Alternatively, you can add `LINEA` to this list in the command line by running:
    ```
    --rpc-http-api=ADMIN,NET,ETH,WEB3,TXPOOL,LINEA
    ```

When you run Besu, you will see the `linea-sequencer` plugin registered during startup.
