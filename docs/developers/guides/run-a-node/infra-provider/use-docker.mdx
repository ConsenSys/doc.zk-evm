You can use Docker to run a Linea Besu node, and make use of "profiles"

## Prerequisites

Download and install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

## Run a Linea Besu node

:::warning Important

The Besu Docker image does not run on Windows.

:::

### Step 1. Download the relevant `docker-compose.yaml` file

Find and download the `.yaml` file from the [`/docker` directory](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-besu-package/tree/main/docker) in the Linea Besu repository.

The `.yaml` file you need depends on the Linea Besu profile you want for your node, which, in turn, depends on your use case:
- `follower`:
- `sequencer`:
- `shomei`:
- `tracer`:

### Step 2. Update IP address

In the `.yaml` file you downloaded, adjust the `--p2p-host` command with your public IP address:

```yaml
--p2p-host=103.10.10.10
```

:::tip

You can use [this page](https://www.whatismyip.com/) to find your public IP address.
