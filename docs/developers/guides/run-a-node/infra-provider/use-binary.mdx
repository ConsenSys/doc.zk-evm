description: Install the Linea Besu client and plugins to run a node as an infrastructure provider.

# Use a binary distribution

You can install Linea Besu to run a Linea node

The Besu installation depends on your intended purpose for the node:
- If you are an infrastructure provider, you need to use [Linea Besu](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-besu-package). 
Linea-specific JSON-RPC API methods such as `linea_estimateGas` will only work correctly if the node 
they are called on has the appropriate plugins installed and configured. 
- If you simply want to run a follower node and keep a local copy of the chain, you can use either
standard Besu or Linea Besu.
