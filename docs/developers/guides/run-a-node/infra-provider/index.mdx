# Run a node: infrastructure providers

Linea Besu is an implementation of the Hyperledger Besu client that extends its functionality. 

We recommend using Linea Besu over standard Besu if you intend to run a node and use it to interact with the blockchain, rather than just [following it](../follower/index.mdx). 

Linea Besu enables you to use plugins adapted specifically for Linea:
- [Linea Sequencer](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-sequencer)
- [Shomei](https://github.com/Consensys/shomei)
- [gnark](https://github.com/Consensys/gnark).

These plugins are necessary, in different ways, to enable full functionality for the node. Linea-specific API endpoints like `linea_estimateGas`, for example, require the `linea-sequencer` plugin.

These guides are for infrastructure providers and operators who intend to run a Linea node. This is 
relevant to you if:
- You are responsible for operating nodes as a service for others to use
- You want to use Linea with a personal, private RPC endpoint. 

You can choose to download a binary distribution or use Docker:
