As Web3 platforms, protocols, and dapps become more mainstream, there is an increasing demand for these companies to know their users’ behaviors and connections. Thus, having a partner that can help companies and developers understand their users better is important for Linea and its mission to provide better scalability. 

This article provides information on using Scopescan and its analytical tools to determine authentic users and their relations on LInea.

## Scopescan and its unique value proposition
Understanding Web3 users’ patterns can be difficult, especially given that any particular user can have multiple addresses and that Web3 prioritizes privacy. Unlike their Web2 counterparts, Web3 companies understandably have additional hurdles to clear to fine-tune their products to users’ evolving needs. This is where Scopescan brings unique value to the Linea platform and its projects.

Scopescan is an on-chain data analytics platform that allows the creation of real-time profiles, called entities, with meaningful connections. It features an extensive list of analytical tools that are built on user-based data and powered by the 0xScope Web3 AI Data Layer, for high-quality data extraction and processing that meets the high data standards of AI solutions.

When Scopescan processed Linea as the latest addition to its lineup of supported blockchains, it looked into all the addresses of this chain and the relationships between these addresses. This way, Scopescan users will be able to see the behavior of any user on the Linea chain, and then discover connections between these users. When Linea ecosystem projects leverage this entity-related information, they can understand their users better and fine-tune their strategies to grow their user base.

## Scopescan’s analytical tools

Scopescan is equipped with a variety of tools that help the Linea community better understand users, projects, and their interconnections. Here are the three categories through which Scopescan’s lineup of tools are categorized:

**1. Discovery Mode**

In this mode, Scopescan users can find profiles of the top addresses, tokens, and projects on the Linea network. These profile pages serve as comprehensive dashboards containing relevant information about any entity on the Linea network. Below, you can see a sample dashboard for Linea’s projects and addresses.

**2. Alpha Hunting**

This segment of Scopechat contains dashboards focused on identifying potential alpha opportunities related to tokens and projects in the Linea ecosystem. The Live Statistics dashboard (shown in the first picture below) displays statistics such as active users, top gas spenders and consumers, and CEX activity on Linea-supported tokens. There are other dashboards dedicated to whales, VCs, and institutions affiliated with the Linea ecosystem. The second picture below is an example of the Whale Watch dashboard.

In addition, you can create your own dashboard that can track specific addresses on your radar, giving you a key advantage in tracking changes in user behaviors and acting upon them.

**3. Investigation Mode**

Under Investigation Mode, there are several tools focused on transactions and token analytics. For instance, the Address Clustering tool (first picture below) allows you to generate an address graph that visualizes likely connected addresses, based on a search for a single address. Meanwhile, the Money Flow tool (second picture below) allows users to investigate, track and share relevant information on blockchain transactions.
