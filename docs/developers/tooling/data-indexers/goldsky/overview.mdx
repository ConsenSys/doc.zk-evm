[Goldsky](https://goldsky.com) is a data indexing provider for Linea enabling you to extract, 
transform, and load onchain data to power application and analytics use cases. Goldsky offers two 
primary approaches to indexing and accessing blockchain data: [Index](#index) (subgraphs) and [Mirror](#mirror) 
(real-time data replication pipelines).

## Index

[Index](./goldsky-index.mdx) is a hosted subgraph solution with native support for Linea (both 
testnet and mainnet). Subgraphs allow you to define a data schema and how blockchain data should be 
indexed for querying, and can be deployed to Goldsky directly from the command line. If you've built 
with subgraphs in the past, you can work with Goldsky's hosted service with no change to your 
development flow, and take advantage of several key benefits:

- **Cross-chain**: Native cross-chain and multi-chain support to query data from multiple 
blockchains from a single endpoint, automatically managing event order, re-orgs, and other 
complexities.
- **RPC proxy**: [Goldsky](https://goldsky.com) balances load and manages RPC provider failures 
across 20+ endpoints, maximizing indexing speed and querying reliability.
- **Dev tooling**: Webhooks, version control, data source tags, instant subgraphs without writing a 
line of code, and other goodies to make indexing data easier.
- **White-glove support**: With custom SLAs and support scopes, Goldsky's support team is available 
24/7 to customize your indexing and query server for your specific use case, and to help if things 
go wrong.

## Mirror

[Mirror](./goldsky-mirror.mdx) is a real-time data replication system that allows you to keep 
blockchain data where your app is. Mirror pipelines instruct [Goldsky](https://goldsky.com) 
where to take data from, how to (optionally) process it, and where to persist the results. Compared 
to subgraphs, Mirror pipelines differ in a few key ways:

- **Self-hosted**: Results are persisted in a database or as flat files rather than being served 
only via a remotely-hosted API. This allows for seamless colocation of indexed data alongside 
your app and (private) user data.
- **Self-healing**: Mirror pipelines benefit from the wisdom of the crowd - quality checks, fixes, 
and improvements to the data are applied automatically through upserts and deletes directly in your 
database.
- **Scalable**: You can index data from multiple sources (and push it to multiple sinks, and with 
transformations) in parallel, and with infinite horizontal scaling, allowing you to complete 
historical backfills in record speed.
- **Simple**: Mirror pipelines can be defined and executed entirely through a five-step interactive 
CLI, or with simple JSON configuration files and some SQL for more flexibility.
