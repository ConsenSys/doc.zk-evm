SubQuery is a blockchain data indexer that provides developers with fast,
flexible, universal, open source and decentralized APIs for web3 projects.
SubQuery SDK allows developers to get rich indexed data and build decentralized
applications more efficiently. SubQuery supports 100+ ecosystems including
Linea, Ethereum, Polygon, Polkadot, Algorand, NEAR, and Avalanche.

One of SubQuery's key features is that it aggregates data across multiple
blockchains within a single project. This allows you to create feature-rich
dashboard analytics and multi-chain block scanners.

Other features include multiple RPC endpoint configurations, multi-worker
capabilities and a configurable caching architecture.

## Get started

Take a look at this SubQuery starter project that introduces SubQuery's Linea
support by indexing
[Linea](https://github.com/subquery/ethereum-subql-starter/tree/main/Linea/linea-starter).

## Running and hosting Linea SubQuery APIs

SubQuery is open-source, meaning you can run it in three ways:

- Locally on your own computer (or a cloud provider of your choosing). View the
  instructions for
  [running SubQuery locally](https://academy.subquery.network/run_publish/run.html).
- Publish to SubQuery's enterprise-level
  [Managed Service](https://managedservice.subquery.network/), where we'll host
  your SubQuery project in production-ready services for mission-critical data
  with zero-downtime blue/green deployments. A free tier is also available.
  [Learn more.](https://academy.subquery.network/run_publish/publish.html).
- Publish to the decentralized
  [SubQuery Network](https://subquery.network/network), an open and scalable
  data service for dapp developers. The SubQuery Network indexes and services
  data to the global community in an incentivised and verifiable way and
  supports Linea from launch.
