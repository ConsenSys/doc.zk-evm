1. Click “Get Started”
2. Enter your email address
3. Check your email and click the link to sing in
4. You are now redirected to [https://dashboard.decommas.io/](https://dashboard.decommas.io/), which contains your API keys
Make sure you’ve got your API keys ready. Copy and paste them to a spot where you can easily find them, but keep them safe too. 

### Setting up DeCommas API in your environment
You can set up the DeCommas API in your environment using either of these two methods: one is via a raw HTTPS request, and the other is using a special toolkit if you’re into JavaScript.

If you choose the first option, the call will appear as follows:
```
https://datalayer.decommas.net/datalayer/api/v1/tokens/{address}?api-key={YOUR-API-KEY}
```


But if you’re more of a JavaScript whiz, we’ve got a kit for you called the DeCommas SDK. You can grab it from here: [https://github.com/DeCommas/decommas-sdk](https://github.com/DeCommas/decommas-sdk).

Here’s how to start:
Put the DeCommas API inside your Javascript environment by typing:
```bash
npm install @decommas/sdk
```
Once that’s done, just copy and paste the following code:

```javascript
import { Decommas } from '@decommas/sdk';
const decommas = new Decommas();
const getVitalikERC20Balances = async () => {
 const address = '0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045'; // any address
 const tokens = await decommas.address.getTokens({ address });
 console.log(tokens);
};
```

Now you’re all set to make full use of the DeCommas API!
