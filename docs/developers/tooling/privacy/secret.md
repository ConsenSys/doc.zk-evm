## Decentralized Confidential Computing​

On most blockchains, all data must be public. But using Secret’s [Confidential Computing Layer](https://scrt.network/confidential-computing-layer), dApps can communicate with Secret to store and compute over encrypted data. This unlocks powerful new use-cases for Linea applications. Some examples of what this can enable are private voting for DAOs, encrypted storage, secure random number generation, confidential data access via NFTs, sealed-bid auctions, and encrypted order books for DeFi applications.

## How to integrate Secret's CCL​

You can integrate Secret's CCL into an existing Linea application, or design a new application from the ground up to take advantage of the unique use-cases it enables.

To start, check out Secret Network’s [Confidential Computing Layer](https://scrt.network/confidential-computing-layer) landing page to get an overview of how it works, and example use-cases for inspiration. From there you’ll find multiple links to Secret's CCL documentation:

- [Basics](https://docs.scrt.network/secret-network-documentation/development/ethereum-evm-developer-toolkit/basics) - explains the cross-chain communication technologies used, and how to connect a MetaMask wallet to Secret Network.
- [Use-cases](https://docs.scrt.network/secret-network-documentation/development/ethereum-evm-developer-toolkit/usecases) - provides tutorials showing how to build various types of EVM applications using Secret’s CCL. All of these tutorials can be used to connect Linea cross-chain with Secret Network.
- [Supported Networks](https://docs.scrt.network/secret-network-documentation/development/ethereum-evm-developer-toolkit/supported-networks) - provides a list of gateway contract addresses. This is how your Linea application will communicate with Secret.
