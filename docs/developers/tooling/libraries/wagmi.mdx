Wagmi is a collection of React hooks containing everything you need to start
working with Linea.

Wagmi makes it easy for users to connect their wallet, display ENS names and
balance information, sign messages, interact with contracts, and much more â€” all
with caching, request deduplication, and persistence. Wagmi supports Linea
(along with MetaMask).

To point to your dapp on Linea, use the chain tag `lineaSepolia` for Linea
Sepolia and `linea` for Linea Mainnet.

For specifics, [see the docs](https://wagmi.sh/core/chains#supported-chains).
