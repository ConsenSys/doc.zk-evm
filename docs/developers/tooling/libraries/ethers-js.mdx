The ethers.js library aims to be a complete and compact library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and its ecosystem â€” including Linea, due to its EVM-equivalence. Ethers.js simplifies Ethereum development, enhances code quality, and provides a modern and efficient alternative to older Ethereum development libraries.

To learn more about ethers.js take a look at the official [documentation](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/).
