Based on our experience, we developed Viem with a TypeScript interface for Ethereum that provides low-level stateless features for interactions focused on reliability, performance, and a great developer experience.

To point to your dapp on Linea, you need to use `import { linea, lineaSepolia } from 'viem/chains'` 'lineaSepolia', and `linea` for Linea Mainnet.

For more specifics, see here: [https://viem.sh/docs/chains/introduction](https://viem.sh/docs/chains/introduction).
