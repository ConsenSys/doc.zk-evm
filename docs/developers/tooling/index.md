# Developer tooling and infrastructure

In this section, we cover developer tooling and infrastructure projects deployed on Linea to help you build the next killer dapp. Building a dapp can be a complex task, but luckily we have great tools and developer infrastructure that can unlock new use cases and speed up the development of your dapp.

Building on top of existing protocols, tooling, and infrastructure will ensure a faster go-to-market, as the existing library, dapp, or service has gone already through intense testing and adoption.

Before you begin building, ensure you've:

1. [Set up your wallet](../../use-linea/set-up-your-wallet.md)
1. [Funded your wallet with goerli ETH](../../use-linea/fund.md/#get-test-eth-on-goerli)
1. [Bridged Goerli ETH to Linea](../../use-linea/bridge-funds.md)
