[Supra](https://supraoracles.com/) is a novel, high-throughput oracle and 
intra-layer: a vertically integrated toolkit of cross-chain solutions (data 
oracles, asset bridges, automation network, and more) that interlink all 
blockchains, public (L1s and L2s) or private (enterprises).

Supra provides decentralized oracle price feeds that can be used for onchain and 
offchain use-cases such as spot and perpetual DEXs, lending protocols, and 
payments protocols. Supra's oracle chain and consensus algorithm makes it the 
fastest-to-finality oracle provider, with layer-1 security guarantees. The pull 
oracle has a sub-second response time. Aside from speed and security, Supra's 
rotating node architecture gathers data from 40+ data sources and applies a 
robust calculation methodology to get the most accurate value. The node 
provenance on the data dashboard also provides a fully transparent historical 
audit trail. Supra's Distributed Oracle Agreement (DORA) paper was accepted into 
ICDCS 2023, the oldest distributed systems conference.
