[Arcana Network](https://arcana.network) SDKs integrate with web3 apps to enable gasless 
transactions in the embedded, non-custodial [Arcana Wallet](../social-login/arcana.md#arcana-wallet) 
and third-party browser-based wallets.

Web3 app developers can use the [Arcana Dashboard](https://dashboard.arcana.network) to add gas 
tanks on one or more blockchain networks, deposit funds to sponsor gas fees, and whitelist app 
operations.
