# Hal Stream

As a Web3 developer, manual monitoring of on-chain activities can be a complex and time-consuming task. Integrating real-time blockchain data into existing tools or platforms often requires custom infrastructure. Hal Stream is a no-code tool that delivers real-time data streaming from the Linea blockchain, automating the process of tracking and filtering blockchain events and exposing it in a standard way.

Hal Stream is available at [hal.xyz](https://www.hal.xyz/products/hal-stream).
