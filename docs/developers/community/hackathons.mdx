## The Linea Dev Cook-Off

**Create, Iterate, and Innovate!** :frog:

Every month, Linea will host a mini, online buildathon to celebrate and reward continuous hacking! We will have a 1 ETH pool prize distributed to qualified projects.

You can create a new project, iterate on an ongoing one, or revive and refresh that old side project you've been wanting to get back to.

That means you don't need to start from scratch! The only requirement is that you're building with Linea, made progress on your project in the current month, and you've posted about your project on social (and included a frog somewhere)!

This is a great opportunity to win some small prizes alongside your regular building, improve on past hackathon projects, and get exposure to the Linea team and community!

Literally, win cool prizes for just shipping.

#### Things to note
- You can submit on behalf of a formal organization (profit-seeking company or DAO), but priority will be given to independent hackers
- You can make multiple submissions
- You can use old code!
- Bonus points for adding a frog somewhere in your submission :wink: :frog:
- Bonus points will be awarded to projects that incorporate the partner tooling found [here](/developers/tooling)

#### Examples of acceptable work
- Flappy bird, but with frogs :frog: and on-chain
- A step-by-step, published tutorial on how to build a (maybe frog-themed :frog:) dapp on Linea
- A translated guide on how to build on Linea
- A published video explainer on how to build with Linea or Linea concepts
- Improving the UI of a hackathon project you built before
- A Dune dashboard demonstrating something cool about Linea activity
- An [onthis.xyz](https://onthis.xyz) shortcut to improve onchain UX

#### Judging criteria
- Functionality and technicality - How complete and complex is the project?
- Really great UX - How easy is it for a new user to navigate or how easy it is to follow the tutorial?
- Originality - How original and innovative is the project? Is it pushing the boundaries of on-chain use cases?
- Goshdarnit this is cool - A catch-all vibe check for projects that are simply fun to interact with

#### What counts as a qualifying submission

If you're submitting a dapp or Farcaster frame...
- Open source, public Github repo
- Non-trivial progress made on your project during that month (as measured by your Github commit history)
- Verified smart contract deployed on Linea Sepolia or Linea Mainnet
- Working product demo link
- Short video explainer and demo (less than 5 minutes) of your project and, if it's not a new project, what changes you made that month
- Posted and tagged on Twitter ([@lineabuild](http://x.com/lineabuild)) or Farcaster ([@linea](http://warpcast/linea))

If you're submitting a tutorial...
- Open source, public Github repo
- Published tutorial link
- Non-trivial progress made on your project during that month (as measured by your Github commit history)
- Bonus points for publishing an accompanying video explainer
- Posted and tagged on Twitter ([@lineabuild](http://x.com/lineabuild)) or Farcaster ([@linea](http://warpcast/linea))

If you're submitting a Dune analytics dashboard...
- Dune dashboard link
- Non-trivial progress made on your project during that month
- Posted and tagged on Twitter ([@lineabuild](http://x.com/lineabuild)) or Farcaster ([@linea](http://warpcast/linea))

Ultimately, a "high-quality" submission is quite subjective, but you can imagine invalid submissions as something like unusable demos, projects that are simply slightly modified clones of other projects, and otherwise scrapped together hacks that took little to no effort to put together.

#### How to submit

Submissions details to come!

### May 2024 (1 ETH + $500 USD [Dune API](https://docs.dune.com/api-reference/overview/introduction) pool prize + onthis.xyz track) :frog:

This month, you can win both the 1 ETH pool prize in addition to extra prize money for using the [Dune API](https://docs.dune.com/api-reference/overview/introduction). We'll be prioritizing submissions that are building a shortcut via [onthis.xyz](https://onthis.xyz) or with the Dune API.

**Register and submit [here](https://linea.deform.cc/cook-off-may-2024)**

**Due 11:59PM EST, May 31st, 2024**

#### 1 ETH pool prize

We'll be distributing 1 ETH amongst the top qualified projects. This can take the form of two outstanding projects receiving 0.5 ETH each, 10 projects receiving 0.1 ETH each, or, in the case that no submissions meet our quality bar, no ETH being distributed for that month.

#### Workshops

Check out these workshops for the May Dev Cook-Off:

- [Dune API workshop](https://www.youtube.com/live/NB8iCif5Q48?si=UZDtkLk6Ew7t4yGt)
- [Onthis workshop](https://www.youtube.com/live/FIOq1yy85nY?si=RBKlTmhbYDIihrQh)

#### $500 USD [Dune API](https://docs.dune.com/api-reference/overview/introduction) pool prize

[Dune](https://dune.com) is crypto's data platform. Teams and individuals alike use Dune to explore, query, access, and export blockchain data. Dune's community of data engineers, devs, researchers, and analysts use the platform to gain deeper insights into blockchain activity. Dune provides organized, decoded and human-readable blockchain data, across 30+ chains and 1.5M+ datasets.

Dune is looking for the most creative use cases of the Dune API. If you don't know where to start, building a Farcaster frame with the Dune API is a great place to start!
