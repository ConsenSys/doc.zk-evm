## The Linea Dev Cook-Off

**Create, Iterate, and Innovate!** :frog:

Every month, Linea will host a mini, online buildathon to celebrate and reward continuous hacking! 
We will have a $10,000 prize pool to distribute to qualified projects.

You can create a new project, iterate on an ongoing one, or revive and refresh that old side 
project you've been wanting to get back to.

That means you don't need to start from scratch! The only requirement is that you're building with 
Linea, made progress on your project in the current month, and you've posted about your project on 
social (and included a frog somewhere)!

This is a great opportunity to win some small prizes alongside your regular building, improve on 
past hackathon projects, and get exposure to the Linea team and community!

Literally, win cool prizes for just shipping.

#### Things to note
- You can submit on behalf of a formal organization (profit-seeking company or DAO), but priority will be given to independent hackers
- You can make multiple submissions
- You can use old code!
- Bonus points for adding a frog somewhere in your submission :wink: :frog:
- Bonus points will be awarded to projects that incorporate the partner [tooling](../tooling/index.mdx)

#### Examples of acceptable work
- Flappy bird, but with frogs :frog: and on-chain
- A step-by-step, published tutorial on how to build a (maybe frog-themed :frog:) dapp on Linea
- A translated guide on how to build on Linea
- A published video explainer on how to build with Linea or Linea concepts
- Improving the UI of a hackathon project you built before
- A Dune dashboard demonstrating something cool about Linea activity
- An [onthis.xyz](https://onthis.xyz) shortcut to improve onchain UX

#### Judging criteria
- Functionality and technicality - How complete and complex is the project?
- Really great UX - How easy is it for a new user to navigate or how easy it is to follow the tutorial?
- Originality - How original and innovative is the project? Is it pushing the boundaries of on-chain use cases?
- Goshdarnit this is cool - A catch-all vibe check for projects that are simply fun to interact with

#### What counts as a qualifying submission

If you're submitting a dapp or Farcaster frame...
- Open source, public Github repo
- Non-trivial progress made on your project during that month (as measured by your Github commit history)
- Verified smart contract deployed on Linea Sepolia or Linea Mainnet
- Working product demo link
- Short video explainer and demo (less than 5 minutes) of your project and, if it's not a new project, what changes you made that month
- Posted and tagged on Twitter ([@lineabuild](http://x.com/lineabuild)) or Farcaster ([@linea](https://warpcast.com/linea))

If you're submitting a tutorial...
- Open source, public Github repo
- Published tutorial link
- Non-trivial progress made on your project during that month (as measured by your Github commit history)
- Bonus points for publishing an accompanying video explainer
- Posted and tagged on Twitter ([@lineabuild](http://x.com/lineabuild)) or Farcaster ([@linea](https://warpcast.com/linea))

If you're submitting a Dune analytics dashboard...
- Dune dashboard link
- Non-trivial progress made on your project during that month
- Posted and tagged on Twitter ([@lineabuild](http://x.com/lineabuild)) or Farcaster ([@linea](https://warpcast.com/linea))

Ultimately, a "high-quality" submission is quite subjective, but you can imagine invalid submissions as something like unusable demos, projects that are simply slightly modified clones of other projects, and otherwise scrapped together hacks that took little to no effort to put together.

#### How to submit

Register and submit [**here**](https://www.hackquest.io/en/hackathon/explore/Linea-Oct-Nov-Dev-Cook-off)

### October-November 2024 (10,000 USDT in prizes!) :frog:

This month, you can win a share of an 5,000 USDT prize pool for general track submissions, or a 
share of another 5,000 USDT pool for integrating Verax/Hemera. [See the Hackquest page](https://www.hackquest.io/en/hackathon/explore/Linea-Oct-Nov-Dev-Cook-off).

**Due 23:59(GMT+8), November 30, 2024**

#### General track: 5,000 USDT prize pool

We'll be distributing 5,000 USDT amongst the top qualified projects. This can take the form of two 
outstanding projects receiving 2,500 USDT each, 10 projects receiving 500 USDT each, or, in the case 
that no submissions meet our quality bar, no prize being distributed for that month.

#### Verax/Hemera track: 5,000 USDT prize pool

There are five themes we suggest for hackers trying to integrate with Verax/Hemera. Prize money 
will be distributed among qualifying projects that successfully integrate with Verax/Hemera, based 
on these themes:

- Theme 1: Linea Ecosystem Data Analytics App/Dashboard 
- Theme 2: SocialFi
- Theme 3: DeFi
- Theme 4: GameFi
- Theme 5: DiD (Decentralized Identity)
