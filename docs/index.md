# Linea

Linea is a type 2 zero knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM). A zkEVM replicates the Ethereum environment as a rollup and allows developers to build on it as they would on Ethereum mainnet. Linea allows you to deploy any smart contract, use any tool, and develop as if you're building on Ethereum. For users, this enables the experience and security guarantees of Ethereum, but with lower transaction costs.

## How do I use Linea?

Linea released its public testnet 3/28 and is launching an upcoming NFT testnet voyage. Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lineabuild) for updates!
