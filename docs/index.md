# ConsenSys zkEVM

## What is ConsenSys zkEVM?

ConsenSys zkEVM is a type 2 zero knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM). A zkEVM replicates
the Ethereum environment as a rollup, and allows developers to build on it as they would on Ethereum mainnet.
The ConsenSys zkEVM network allows you to deploy any smart contract, use any tool, and develop
as if you're building on Ethereum. For users, this enables the experience and security guarantees
of Ethereum, but with lower transaction costs.

## How do I join the private testnet?

If youâ€™re interested in joining the private testnet, then [join the waiting list](https://www.infura.io/resources/network/consensys-zkevm-beta-signup).
Dapp developers, users, researchers, and existing protocols are encouraged to join and help scale Ethereum.

Once your wallet address is granted access, you'll be allowed to bridge funds (Goerli ETH) to the
network and begin using it. Until then, please wait for an email to confirm that your account has access.
