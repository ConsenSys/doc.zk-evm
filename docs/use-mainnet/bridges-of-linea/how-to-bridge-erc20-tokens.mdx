:::note

We recommend that only tech operators that are providing liquidity use the official Linea bridge to transfer ERC-20 tokens.

### For everyday bridge transfers, we recommend you use [MetaMask Portfolio's Bridge feature](https://portfolio.metamask.io/bridge), which aggregates bridging options across Linea and shows you the best rates.

For a closer look at the bridges that MetaMask Portfolio sources from, check out our information about [third-party bridges](/use-mainnet/bridges-of-linea#third-party-permissionless-bridges).

### Transferring ERC-20 tokens via the official Linea bridge

**ERC-20 tokens can only be bridged via [manual claiming](/use-mainnet/bridges-of-linea#manual-vs-automatic-claiming), which requires you to cover the ETH fee on the destination layer. Make sure your wallet is properly funded before beginning this process!**

If you're bridging a token to Linea that hasn't been deployed before and you see a difference in the transferred token amount, don't worry â€“ your tokens aren't lost. This could be a "[token bridge decimal mismatch](/use-mainnet/bridges-of-linea#what-is-token-bridge-decimal-mismatch)," which affects how the value is displayed. The chance of encountering this is quite low, but still good to know about.

Check out the [tutorial](/use-mainnet/bridges-of-linea/how-to-bridge-eth) on how to bridge ETH to learn how to use our bridge and appropriately fund your wallet.

1. Go to our token bridge [here](https://bridge.linea.build/).

2. Connect your wallet in the top-right corner of the page.

3. On the [token bridge](https://bridge.linea.build/), go to the token selection menu by clicking on the current token symbol (ETH in this case).

4. Select one of the available tokens in the list. If the token is not in the list, paste the address of the token you want to add into the search bar.

      alt="Linea bridge select token list"
    />
  </div>
</div>

5. Click on the token to select it.

6. You now can bridge this token, and it will be saved in your token list for future bridging.
