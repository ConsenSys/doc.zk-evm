This is a step by step guide to bridging ETH between Ethereum Mainnet (L1) to Linea (L2).

**To bridge ETH over testnet, simply click the testnet button at the bottom left of the [token bridge page](https://bridge.linea.build/) and follow the same steps as below.**

If you would like to bridge between other networks, check out [third-party bridges](/use-mainnet/bridges-of-linea#third-party-permissionless-bridges).

## Bridging ETH from Ethereum (L1) to Linea (L2)

:::caution

Please use the [automatic claiming option](/use-mainnet/bridges-of-linea#manual-vs-automatic-claiming) the first time you bridge ETH from L1 to L2. [Manual claiming](/use-mainnet/bridges-of-linea#manual-vs-automatic-claiming) requires you to have L2 ETH available to pay for the fees. **If you don't have enough L2 ETH to cover the fees, your transaction will be stuck on the bridge until you can cover the fees!**

:::

### Automatic Claiming

1. Go to our token bridge [here](https://bridge.linea.build/).

2. Connect your wallet in the top-right corner of the page.

      .default
  }></img>

3. Verify that the bridge is set to Ethereum → Linea Mainnet and that automatic claiming is enabled.

4. Enter the amount of ETH you want to bridge over to Linea Mainnet, and select the “Start Bridging” button.

  }></img>

5. MetaMask will pop up asking you to confirm the transaction.

      .default
  }></img>

6. After confirming the transaction, it should take around 20 minutes for the transaction to reach Linea Mainnet. You can see your pending transaction under the "Recent transactions" section at the bottom of the token bridge.

    require("@site/static/img/docs/use-mainnet/bridges-of-linea/pending-transaction-l1-to-l2.png")
      .default
  }></img>

7. You’re done! Under "Recent transactions", it should say "Bridging complete" and your ETH should be on Linea Mainnet. _Reminder: It takes around 20 minutes for the bridging process to complete._

    require("@site/static/img/docs/use-mainnet/bridges-of-linea/confirmed-transaction-l1-to-l2.png")
      .default
  }></img>

8. You can see your Linea account balance in MetaMask once you switch to the Linea network. You can also check it on [LineaScan](https://lineascan.build/address/0x331FB12C080F5b34F0E8812D44114D17398A016d). Just replace the account address in the URL with your account address and it should reflect your account's balance!

## Bridging ETH from Linea Mainnet (L2) to Ethereum Mainnet (L1)

:::note

Automatic claiming is only available for bridging ETH from L1 to L2. You will not be able to select this option for L2 to L1 bridging.

:::

1. Go to our token bridge [here](https://bridge.linea.build/).

2. Connect your wallet in the top-right corner of the page.

  }></img>

3. Verify that the bridge is set to Linea Mainnet -> Ethereum. Manual claiming is the only available option for L2 to L1 bridging.

4. Enter the amount of ETH you want to bridge over to Ethereum Mainnet, and select the “Start Bridging” button.
