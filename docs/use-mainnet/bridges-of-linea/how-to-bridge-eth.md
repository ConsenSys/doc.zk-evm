:::note


We recommend that only tech operators that are providing liquidity use the official Linea bridge to transfer ETH.

### For everyday bridge transfers, we recommend you use [MetaMask Portfolio's Bridge feature](https://portfolio.metamask.io/bridge), which aggregates bridging options across Linea and shows you the best rates.

For a closer look at the bridges that MetaMask Portfolio sources from, check out our information about [third-party bridges](./bridging-non-dev.mdx#third-party-permissionless-bridges).

### Transferring ETH via the official Linea bridge

This is a step by step guide to bridging ETH between Ethereum Mainnet (L1) to Linea (L2).

**To bridge ETH over testnet, simply click the testnet button at the bottom left of the [token bridge page](https://bridge.linea.build/) and follow the same steps as below.**

If you would like to bridge between other networks, check out [third-party bridges](./bridging-non-dev.mdx#third-party-permissionless-bridges).

**Check out this video on how to use our bridge!**

## Bridging ETH from Ethereum (L1) to Linea (L2)

:::caution

Please use the [automatic claiming option](./index.mdx#manual-vs-automatic-claiming) the first time you bridge ETH from L1 to L2. [Manual claiming](./index.mdx#manual-vs-automatic-claiming) requires you to have L2 ETH available to pay for the fees. **If you don't have enough L2 ETH to cover the fees, your transaction will be stuck on the bridge until you can cover the fees!**

:::

### Automatic Claiming

1. Go to our token bridge [here](https://bridge.linea.build/).

2. Connect your wallet in the top-right corner of the page.

      alt="Linea bridge connect wallet button"
    />
  </div>
</div>

3. Verify that the bridge is set to Ethereum → Linea Mainnet and that automatic claiming is enabled.

4. Enter the amount of ETH you want to bridge over to Linea Mainnet, and select the “Start Bridging” button.

      alt="Confirm Linea bridge transaction in MetaMask"
    />
  </div>
</div>

6. After confirming the transaction, it should take around 20 minutes for the transaction to reach Linea Mainnet. You can see your pending transaction under the "Recent transactions" section at the bottom of the token bridge.

      alt="Linea bridge pending transaction"
    />
  </div>
</div>

7. You’re done! Under "Recent transactions", it should say "Bridging complete" and your ETH should be on Linea Mainnet. _Reminder: It takes around 20 minutes for the bridging process to complete._
