To get started with bridging to and from Linea, head to the official [Linea bridge page](https://bridge.linea.build/).

From here, you can select the option most appropriate to you:

- The bridge feature in MetaMask Portfolio, which we recommend as a simple option for most users;
- Third-party bridges, if you want to use an alternative; or
- The Linea native bridge, which is best suited to tech operators, dapp teams, and liquidity 
providers. For more guidance on the native bridge, see [here](./index.mdx).

### Using ecosystem bridges

As mentioned, MetaMask Portfolio's Bridge feature surveys bridges across Linea to source its routes and rates.

For more information on those bridges and **how to move between Ethereum, Linea, and other networks**, please see [here](#third-party-permissionless-bridges).

There are already a large number of ERC-20 tokens available for everyday use, as well as multi-chain transfers and functionality.

### Third-party, permissionless bridges

You can find third-party bridges by heading over to our [ecosystem portal](https://linea.build/apps) and filtering for bridges.

:::caution

Note that these are permissionless bridges. As always, you should do your own research before interacting with dapps in order to keep your funds safe.
