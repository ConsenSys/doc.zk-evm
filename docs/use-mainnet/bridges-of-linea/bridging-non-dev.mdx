title: Bridge your funds

### For all normal bridge traffic: 

#### **We recommend you use the Bridge feature of MetaMask Portfolio: [https://portfolio.metamask.io/bridge](https://portfolio.metamask.io/bridge)**
>
>The Linea ecosystem has a **growing and diverse number of bridges** operating on it. 
>
>MetaMask Portfolio's Bridge feature leverages existing aggregators and individual bridges to show the options available to you so that you can **choose the provider and rate that you prefer**. Then, you can perform the bridging operation right from the dapp.

**[Go to the Portfolio Bridge](https://portfolio.metamask.io/bridge)**

:::info
For dapp teams, liquidity providers, and technology operators bridging large amounts of liquidity, please use [this page](/use-mainnet/bridges-of-linea/index.mdx) to see what your best options are.

### Using ecosystem bridges

As mentioned, MetaMask Portfolio's Bridge feature surveys bridges across Linea to source its routes and rates.

For more information on those bridges and **how to move between Ethereum, Linea, and other networks**, please see [here](#third-party-permissionless-bridges).

There are already a large number of ERC-20 tokens available for everyday use, as well as multi-chain transfers and functionality.

### Third-Party, Permissionless Bridges

You can find third-party bridges by heading over to our [ecosystem portal](https://linea.build/apps) and filtering for bridges.

:::caution

Note that these are permissionless bridges. As always, you should do your own research before interacting with dapps in order to keep your funds safe.
