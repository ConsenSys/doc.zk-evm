**Introduction**

Linea Surge is an LXP-driven program that rewards people for having assets on Linea and gives bonuses for deploying those assets into protocols.  \
 \
The goal for The Surge is allow users that provide liquidity on the network to collect LXP-L. LXP-L is similar to the system we have in place today for LXP, but is collected by contributing liquidity to Linea. A core focus is on the expansion of available assets through new applications and DeFi use cases built on Linea. Additional liquidity enables the sustainable support for additional volume, in turn impacting on the sustainability of the liquidity through increased fees for liquidity providers and increasing the percentage of ecosystem trading activity compared to other venues, creating a fly-wheel network effect for the ecosystem.

In the next sections we will explore the program in the overview page and will get in the detail of the math behind the program in the Point Incentive Design page.
