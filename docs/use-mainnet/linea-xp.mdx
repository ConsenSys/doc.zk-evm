## What is Linea Voyage XP?

Similar to video games, where your character can gain experience points (XP) as you go through the game, Voyage XP represents your journey and experience in the Linea ecosystem. The Voyage XP tokens will be a custom version of ERC-20 and will be visible by default in your MetaMask wallet.

**Voyage XP tokens are non-transferrable, soulbound tokens that are distributed to recognize the communityâ€™s extraordinary contribution toward the growth of the Linea ecosystem. They do not have any monetary value!**

Apart from being a measure of contribution to building Linea into a robust and secure L2 network, Voyage XP will also make owners eligible for benefits such as receiving official community roles, exclusive Linea swag, and more!

:::note
Voyage XP are non-transferable and not bridgeable to other networks. You cannot buy, sell, or swap them, nor can you accumulate them by transferring from another wallet.

Account binding allows you to aggregate your Voyage XP tokens to a single primary account. If you're navigating the Linea ecosystem with multiple accounts, choose one as your main hub to effortlessly accumulate all the Voyage XP you've received. This ensures that every adventure is accurately recorded across your interconnected accounts, providing a seamless and comprehensive representation of your Linea experience.

**Account binding is not retroactive. If you bind your account address after Voyage XP are received, then those won't be linked to the primary account!**

:::caution

**Account binding is permanent and irreversible, so make sure you are choosing the correct account address when going through the process!**

- Using account binding is only necessary for those who want to bind two or more accounts.

- To receive LXP, the Primary account set must pass Proof of Humanity to receive LXP. Accounts set as secondary do not need to pass PoH.

- All LXP will be sent to your Primary account when using Account Binding

- You will receive LXP once per task. The exception to this is the Linea Voyage Testnet NFT, holders will receive LXP for each NFT owned.
