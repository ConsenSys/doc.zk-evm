### The Surge - Overview

The program is set to officially start on 9th April. It will last for 6 months or if the network TVL will reach 3B$, whatever happens first. From a structure perspective, it will feature 6 Volts (epochs) each one 1 month long. Why Volts? Because if we reach the target we will let the epoch go till the end of the Volt. And we can play with themes: every Volt will have narratives, feature partners, and provide educational content. It’s an experience as a whole.


#### Early Adopters

The point system will start when the program goes live but we already have users and early adopters that provided liquidity so far on the network. It's important to give credits for what has been done so far. For this reason, the formula that defines points has an early adopter modifier that provides more points to users that started contributing to the growth earlier than others.


#### Dashboard

After the go-live, OpenBlock Labs will provide a dashboard where everyone can verify the number of LXP-L collected within The Surge. This will feature all necessary information for a user to observe their activity and points received.


#### Sybil

While in previous campaigns we tied the minting of LXP to addresses that hold a Proof Of Humanity to specifically protect the LXP points from bot farms and reduce sybils, in this case there’s no such need. Providing a unit of points per $ locked is an action that does not incentivize bot activity: a user will get the same amount of points if he concentrates all the liquidity in a single wallet or split among thousands of addresses. This makes the experience even easier and more enjoyable for users that bridge liquidity to Linea.


#### Security & UX

Dapps that participate in the program will have a great opportunity to grow, but our first and foremost priorities at Linea are security and UX. We can’t afford to assign LXP-L points to dapps that put users' funds at risk, so this is the right time to increase the bar of security at ecosystem level. Every dapp that is on the ecosystem portal today is audited by one of the Linea security partners and In order to be eligible for being included in the program, a dapp must satisfy the following criteria:



* Meet UX requirements from an established framework
* Satisfy at least one of the 2 following conditions:
    * Live for at least 1 year on any other EVM chains with a TVL peak of more than 50M
    * Provide an audit report associated with the version of the contract that is deployed on Linea and implements at least one real time exploit detection solutions provided by Linea Partners


#### Relationship between LXP and LXP-L

The goal for The Surge is to attract more liquidity by tracking the contribution of each user, leveraging a similar system that we have in place today: LXP-L, will be a different token with the same non transferable characteristic of the LXP issued. both of these points recognize involvement from two distinctly different user bases while providing greater transparency for each cohort.

This approach ensures a balanced alignment between LXP and LXP-L. Considering the complexity of the Surge points model, it is challenging to establish precise alignment for these two types of Points. Implementing a two points system allows us to assess the alignment retrospectively and make necessary adjustments to maintain fairness between users who contribute liquidity and those who contribute through activity.

Moreover, we will continue to provide opportunities for users to contribute to the growth of the ecosystem by performing activity based activations on Linea dapps.
