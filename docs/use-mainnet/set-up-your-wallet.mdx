## Install MetaMask

Linea is designed to be completely compatible with Ethereum. Because of that, **it works with MetaMask right out of the box**.

:::tip

[Get started here](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489531) if you're not familiar with MetaMask identity manager, wallet, and web3 passport.

:::

The MetaMask browser extension and mobile app provides built-in connections to Linea. There's no special wallet setup necessary! The only thing you'll need to do is switch to Linea using the network switcher; if you need some pointers, follow [MetaMask's instructions here](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/16367251716251).

All you need to interact with Linea is to download MetaMask, which you can **[install as a browser extension or mobile app](https://metamask.io/download/)**.

## Using Linea on MetaMask

Linea Mainnet is **included in the available networks in the MetaMask browser extension and mobile app by default**.

To see Linea Goerli, you'll need to click on `Show test networks`, as indicated in the image below. Afterwards, select the Linea Goerli network, and you're good to go.

## OK, so I've got Linea in MetaMask. What now?

**MetaMask is like a swiss army knife**: no matter what you need to do in the decentralized web, it's probably got a tool for it.

That's a good thing, too, because of the **ever-growing number of dapps available on the network**. Check out [the Ecosystem Portal](https://linea.build/apps) to see if your favorite web3 dapp is already here.

Regardless of what you're doing on Linea, you'll likely need some tokens in order to transact. For that, check out our next section: [Getting tokens on Linea](./fund.mdx).

## Is it a MetaMask problem, or a network problem, or dapp problem?

If you're interacting with a dapp on Linea, try that dapp's documentation and resources first. If you can't find your answer there, take a look at the [Linea Support Help Center](https://support.linea.build), and search on the [Linea Community Forums](https://community.linea.build) for related issues. If it seems like a MetaMask issue at that point, jump over to [MetaMask's Help Center](https://support.metamask.io), where you can explore their forums, and start a conversation with Support staff.

## Other wallets

Linea is compatible with any EVM-compatible wallet. If you want to add the Linea network, you can find the relevant network information under [Network information and deployed contracts](./info-contracts.mdx).
