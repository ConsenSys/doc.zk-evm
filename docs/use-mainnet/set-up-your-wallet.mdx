## Install MetaMask

Linea is designed to be completely compatible with Ethereum. Because of that, it works with 
MetaMask right out of the box.

:::tip

[Get started here](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489531) if you're not 
familiar with MetaMask identity manager, wallet, and web3 passport.

:::

The MetaMask browser extension and mobile app provide built-in connections to Linea. There's no 
special wallet setup necessary! 

All you need to interact with Linea is to download MetaMask, which you can [install as a 
browser extension or mobile app](https://metamask.io/download/). Once you've downloaded, the 
only thing you'll need to do is switch to Linea using the network switcher; if you need some 
pointers, follow [MetaMask's instructions here](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/16367251716251).

## Using Linea on MetaMask

Linea Mainnet is included in the available networks in the MetaMask browser extension and mobile 
app by default.

To see Linea Sepolia, you'll need to click on **Show test networks**, as indicated in the image 
below. Afterwards, select the Linea Sepolia network, and you're good to go.

  <div class="img-small">
    {/*switch to "Linea_find_Linea_sepolia2.gif" when Linea Goerli is removed from the UI*/}

  </div>
</div>

## OK, so I've got Linea in MetaMask. What now?

MetaMask is like a Swiss army knife: no matter what you need to do in the decentralized web, 
it's probably got a tool for it.

That's a good thing, too, because of the ever-growing number of dapps available on the network. 
Check out [the ecosystem portal](https://linea.build/apps) to see if your favorite web3 dapp is 
already here.

Regardless of what you're doing on Linea, you'll likely need some tokens in order to transact. 
For that, head on to our next section: [Getting tokens on Linea](./fund.mdx).

## I have an issue: is it a MetaMask problem, a network problem, or a dapp problem?

If you're interacting with a dapp on Linea, try that dapp's documentation and resources first. 
If you can't find your answer there, take a look at the [Linea Support Help Center](https://support.linea.build), 
and search on the [Linea Community Forums](https://community.linea.build) or [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/linea) 
for related issues. If it seems like a MetaMask issue at that point, jump over to 
[MetaMask's Help Center](https://support.metamask.io), where you can explore their forums, and 
start a conversation with support.

## Other wallets

Linea is compatible with any EVM-compatible wallet. If you want to add the Linea network, you can 
find the relevant network information under [Network information and deployed contracts](./info-contracts.mdx).
