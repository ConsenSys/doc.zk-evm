## Install MetaMask

Linea is designed to be completely compatible with Ethereum. Because of that, **it works with MetaMask right out of the box**. (If you're not familiar with the identity manager, wallet, and web3 passport that is MetaMask, [get started here](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489531)).

In fact, **the MetaMask extension wallet provides connections to Linea already built-in**. There's no special wallet setup necessary! The only thing you'll need to do is switch to Linea using the network switcher; if you need some pointers, follow [MetaMask's instructions here](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/16367251716251).

All you need to interact with Linea is to download MetaMask, which you can **[install as a browser extension or mobile app](https://metamask.io/download/)**.

## Using Linea on MetaMask Extension and Mobile

Linea Mainnet is **included in the available networks in MetaMask Extension and Mobile by default**. üíñü¶äüöÄ

In order to see Linea Goerli, you'll need to click on `Show test networks`, as indicated in the image below. Afterwards, select the Linea Goerli network, and you're good to go.

## OK, so I've got Linea in MetaMask. What now?

**MetaMask is like a Swiss Army Knife**: no matter what you need to do in the decentralized web, it's probably got a tool for it.

That's a good thing, too, because of the **ever-growing number of dapps available on the network**. Check out [the Ecosystem Portal](https://linea.build/apps) to see if your favorite web3 dapp is already here.

If you're a developer, check out using [Truffle's Dashboard](https://trufflesuite.com/blog/introducing-truffle-dashboard/) to keep your private keys safe while you [deploy a contract to Linea](https://docs.linea.build/build-on-linea/quickstart/deploy-smart-contract/truffle) (perhaps [an ERC-721?](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/deploy-an-erc-721-contract-on-linea-using-infura-and-truffle-27e5c15c401f))

Regardless of what you're doing on Linea, you'll likely need some tokens in order to transact. For that, check out our next section: [Getting tokens on Linea](./fund.md).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Is it a MetaMask problem, or a network problem, or dapp problem?

If you're interacting with a dapp on Linea, try that dapp's documentation and resources first. If you can't find your answer there, take a look at the [Linea Support Help Center](https://support.linea.build), and search on the [Linea Community Forums](https://community.linea.build) for related issues. If it seems like a MetaMask issue at that point, jump over to [MetaMask's Help Center](https://support.metamask.io), where you can explore their forums, and start a conversation with Support staff.

## Other wallets

Linea is compatible with any EVM-compatible wallet. If you want to add the Linea network, you can find the relevant network information under [Network information and deployed contracts](./info-contracts.md).
