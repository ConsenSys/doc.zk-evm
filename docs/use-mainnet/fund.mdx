## Getting tokens on Linea

There are several ways to get test tokens on Linea:

- [Faucets](#use-a-linea-faucet) (for testnet tokens on Linea Goerli)
- [Joining and asking in the Linea Builders Club](https://linea.deform.cc/linea-builders-club)
- [Bridging between Goerli and Linea Goerli](./bridges-of-linea/index.mdx)
- Sending a DM to [this XMTP chatbot](https://converse.xyz/dm/0x96561c772533d32da71d240820a2fbf6883cf96a) 
at TheGeneralStore.eth

## Use a Linea faucet

If you want to drip Goerli ETH directly to the Linea testnet, use the following faucets. Note that 
you must enter your actual address â€” ENS names will not work.

1. [Infura Linea faucet](https://infura.io/faucet/linea)
2. [Covalent Linea faucet](https://www.covalenthq.com/faucet/)
3. [FAUCETME faucet](https://linea.faucetme.pro/)
4. [LearnWeb3 Faucet](https://learnweb3.io/faucets/linea_goerli)

If you want more ETH than the daily allotted amount, or run into trouble with the above faucets, you
can also [bridge ETH to Linea](/use-mainnet/bridges-of-linea/how-to-bridge-eth). Note that you'll 
need to [get test ETH on Goerli](#get-test-eth-on-goerli) to do so.

If you want to drip other tokens, use the [multi-token Linea faucet](https://faucet.goerli.linea.build/), 
which lists the different tokens you can add to your wallet on the Goerli and Linea Goerli testnet.

## Get test ETH on Goerli

To get Goerli ETH, you'll need to:

1. Navigate to the [Linea faucet](https://faucet.goerli.linea.build/)

      alt="Linea faucet homepage"
    />
  </div>
</div>

2. Connect your wallet and switch to the Goerli test network (make sure you are showing test networks)

      alt="Linea faucet networks"
    />
  </div>
</div>

3. Navigate to the list of faucets linked through the Goerli card
1. Select a faucet and drip Goerli ETH

Transactions on Linea are much cheaper than Ethereum mainnet. 0.2 ETH is enough to execute a 
basic workflow, but feel free to get as much as you need!

## Get test ETH on Linea Goerli

In order to interact with Linea, you can either:

1. [Drip Goerli ETH directly to Linea through the various faucets](#use-a-linea-faucet)
1. [Bridge Goerli ETH to Linea](/use-mainnet/bridges-of-linea/how-to-bridge-eth)

## Get other tokens on Goerli

1. Navigate to the [Linea faucet](https://faucet.goerli.linea.build/)
1. Connect your MetaMask wallet
1. Select the Goerli network in your MetaMask wallet
1. Select the desired token from the list of available tokens

If you want to get tokens that are not ETH or USDC, you'll need to lock ETH as a countermeasure 
for draining liquidity pools.

For example, if you wanted to get 1 USDT on Goerli, you would:

1. Navigate to the [Linea faucet](https://faucet.goerli.linea.build/)
1. Connect your MetaMask wallet
1. Select the Goerli network in your MetaMask wallet
1. Add the USDT token to MetaMask by selecting `Add to MetaMask` on the USDT card
1. Lock 0.0005 ETH by typing in 0.0005 on the USDT card, clicking claim, and confirming and 
paying the gas for the MetaMask transaction.

To get your ETH back, you would unwrap your USDT in the USDT card to receive ETH in a 2000:1 ratio. 
For example, to get back 0.0005 ETH, you would need to unwrap 1 USDT by typing in 1 on the USDT 
card, clicking unwrap, and confirming and paying the gas for the MetaMask transaction.

## Get other tokens on Linea

Selecting the Linea network on the [Linea faucet page](https://faucet.goerli.linea.build/) will 
show you the available tokens on Linea.

:::info

Not all available tokens will drip directly onto Linea. If they are, you will see a `CLAIM` 
button. Otherwise, you will need to navigate to that token's faucet to get it on Goerli and 
then bridge.

:::

Specific tokens require specific bridges. If you want to bridge from Goerli to Linea, you can find 
the tokens, contract addresses, and associated bridges [here](./info-contracts.mdx#token-contract-addresses-and-bridges).

  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem value="mainnet">
  Buying tokens directly on Linea is a straightforward process, using MetaMask Portfolio's Buy feature. 
  
  :::info

    What is MetaMask Portfolio?

[MetaMask Portfolio](https://portfolio.metamask.io/) is a dapp built by our friends at MetaMask 
that allows you to buy, sell, swap, stake, and manage your cryptoassets, among other features.
The Buy feature is one of these functions, and is the same service available [through MetaMask](https://support.metamask.io/hc/articles/360058239311).

## Steps to buy tokens on Linea

1. Navigate to [portfolio.metamask.io](https://portfolio.metamask.io), and connect the account to 
which you want your purchased tokens to be delivered.
2. If you're on a mobile device, select 'Buy' from the hamburger icon menu located in the top left 
 of the screen; on desktop, select the 'Buy' tab on the left.
3. Now you'll see the Buy interface. If you've never used it before, you'll first need to 
**select your region**.
   This information is required because availability of payment methods and providers vary based on 
   your bank's location.
4. **Set the payment method**. Again, if you've used Buy before on your current device, your 
previous choice should be loaded by default.
5. **Select a token**. The token selection menu also allows you to switch networks; it's here 
where you need to locate and select Linea from the networks list.
6. Now you'll see the tokens available to buy on Linea. Pick the one you want to buy, then input 
the amount on the main screen once the tokens menu is gone.
7. You'll instantly see one or more quotes on the right, if you're on a desktop browser. On mobile 
devices, hit 'Get Quotes' to see them.
8. Pick a quote by clicking on it.

Selecting a quote redirects you to the provider's site to complete the transaction. You may need 
to complete KYC ("Know Your Customer"; essentially, identifying yourself) with the provider.

After you've completed the steps with the provider, you'll be routed back to MetaMask Portfolio. 
Timescales for receiving your funds will vary based on the provider and token route.

## Linea Sepolia faucets

An up-to-date list of available Linea Sepolia faucets is available [here](../build-on-linea/goerli-to-sepolia.mdx#faucets).

## Bridge Sepolia ETH to Linea Sepolia

The [native Linea bridge](https://bridge.linea.build/) supports bridging between Sepolia and 
Linea Sepolia.

The first time you use this method, select the **automatic claiming** option. **Manual claiming** 
requires you to have some Sepolia ETH available on L2 to cover fees, so only select **manual 
claiming** when you already have some Linea Sepolia ETH.

How to bridge:

1. Connect your wallet in the top-right corner.
2. Click the **Try testnet** button in the bottom-left of the screen. MetaMask should pop up to 
confirm that you want to change your network to Sepolia; click **Switch network** to confirm.
3. Enter the amount of ETH you want to bridge.
4. Select **Automatic claiming** if this is your first time bridging to Linea Sepolia; otherwise,
you can use **Manual claiming** if you prefer.
5. Click **Start bridging** and confirm the transaction in MetaMask.

If you're unsure whether the bridge was successful:
- Ensure you have the Linea Sepolia network added in MetaMask. You can easily add it on the 
Linea bridge page by switching the displayed network in the top-right to Linea Sepolia. 
Alternatively, you can [add it manually](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360043227612-How-to-add-a-custom-network-RPC#h_01G63GGJ83DGDRCS2ZWXM37CV5)
using the network details [here](../build-on-linea/goerli-to-sepolia.mdx#linea-sepolia-network-details).
- Wait 20 minutes. Bridge transactions can take longer than other transactions.
- Check your balance on the [block explorer](https://sepolia.lineascan.build/).
