# Transfer funds between accounts

You can use your MetaMask wallet to transfer funds between accounts in the ConsenSys zkEVM network.

To do this:

1. Open MetaMask and select **ConsenSys zkEVM** from the network drop-down
1. Select **Send**.
1. Type the address that you want to transfer funds to, or select **Transfer between my accounts**
    if the account belongs to your wallet.
1. Type the amount to transfer and select **Next**, and select **Confirm** to send the transaction.

You can now view the transaction details in the **Activity** tab or [block explorer](https://explorer.goerli.zkevm.consensys.net/).
