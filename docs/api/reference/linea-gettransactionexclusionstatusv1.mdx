# `linea_getTransactionExclusionStatusV1`

Queries a temporary database maintained by the transaction exclusion API service to check if a 
transaction was rejected by the sequencer, connected P2P node, or RPC nodes for exceeding data line limits 
that would prevent the prover from generating a proof.


:::info

You can only check for transaction rejection within seven days of the transaction attempt. Querying
transactions older than this will return a `null` response.

:::

If the transaction is rejected, the API call will succeed and provide the reason; otherwise, it
will return `null`.

## Parameters

`txHash`: [Required] The hash of the subject transaction.

## Returns

- `txHash`: The hash of the subject transaction. 
- `from`: The public address of the account that sent the transaction. 
- `nonce`: Number of transaction made by the sender, in hexadecimal format. 
- `txRejectionStage`: A string detailing the point at which the transaction was rejected. One of:
    - `SEQUENCER`: Rejected by the sequencer.
    - `RPC`: Rejected by an RPC node (e.g. `https://rpc.linea.build`).
    - `P2P`: Rejected by a P2P-connected node (for example, a bootnode). 
- `reasonMessage`: Explains why the transaction was rejected. 
- `blockNumber`: The block that the transaction was rejected from, in hexadecimal format. Only 
returned for transactions rejected by the sequencer. 
- `timestamp`: Time of rejection, in ISO 8601 format.

:::note

This example is purely representative; the database retains transaction data for only seven days, so
you'll be unable to reproduce this response with the above example.

:::

If a transaction was not rejected for exceeding line limits, it will not be found in the database, 
and a `null` result is returned. For example:

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "result": null
}
```

A similar `null` result is also returned if the transaction is older than seven days.
