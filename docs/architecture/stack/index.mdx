The Linea stack is open source, meaning you can inspect the code yourself. 

Each repository is listed below, together with a description of its purpose. Scroll further down for 
links to explainers of each element of Linea's architecture.

## Linea repositories

### [`linea-monorepo`](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-monorepo)

The principal Linea repository — 'mono' meaning it is a single location in which multiple elements
or projects are stored. This includes smart contracts covering Linea's core functions, and key 
pieces of the network architecture such as the prover and the coordinator. 

### [`linea-specifications`](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-specifications)

A repository containing specifications for how the Linea zkEVM functions.

### [`linea-arithmetization`](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-arithmetization)

Arithmetization refers to the process of converting computer programs—logic problems—into 
mathematical problems. The repository contains the elements of the Linea stack responsible for this 
process. 

### [`linea-constraints`](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-constraints)

Constraints are the mathematical conditions which transaction data, converted into traces, must 
satisfy in order for a transaction or set of transactions to be proven.

### [`linea-besu`](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-besu)

The Linea implementation of Hyperledger Besu, an Ethereum client. 

### [`linea-sequencer`](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-sequencer)

The implementation of the sequencer, the component of the Linea stack responsible for ordering and
building blocks, as well as executing them.
