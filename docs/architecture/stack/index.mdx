Linea is open source, meaning you can inspect the code yourself. 

Each repository that hosts the Linea software is listed below, together with a description of its purpose, with [further resources](#architecture-documentation) provided. 

## Linea repositories

### [`linea-monorepo`](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-monorepo)

The principal Linea repository. This mainly includes the smart contracts covering Linea's core 
functions, the prover in charge of generating ZK proofs, the coordinator responsible for multiple 
orchestrations, and the postman for executing bridge messages. 

### [`linea-specification`](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-specification)

Specification of the constraint system underlying Linea's zkEVM.

Constraints are mathematical equations and a constraint system is a collection of such equations. 
Linea's constraint system aims to capture the logic of valid EVM executions.

The constraints specified here are implemented in the `linea-constraints` repo.

### [`linea-constraints`](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-constraints)

Implementation of the constraint system specified in the `linea-specification` repo.

Linea's constraint system applies to so-called "traces", which are large matrices of fixed width 
(i.e. fixed number of columns or "registries") and variable depth (correlating with the complexity 
of the EVM execution). The production of such traces is the job of the `linea-tracer` repo.

Constraints and traces are two of the inputs to the prover.

### [`linea-tracer`](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-tracer)

Tracing refers to the process of extracting data from the execution of an EVM client in order to 
construct large matrices known as execution traces. Execution traces are subject to the constraint 
system specified in the `linea-specification` repo and implemented in the `linea-constraints` repo.

The repository contains the elements of Linea responsible for this process.

### [`linea-besu`](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-besu)

The Linea implementation of Hyperledger Besu, an Ethereum client. 

### [`linea-sequencer`](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-sequencer)

The implementation of the sequencer, the component of Linea responsible for ordering and building 
blocks, as well as executing them.
