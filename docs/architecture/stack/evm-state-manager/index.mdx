The state manager is the part of the execution client responsible for updating the state of the 
network globally, and the state of every account individually. The state manager also audits the 
"read" access made in the EVM.

"State", in this context, refers to the data stored on the blockchain at any given point in time. To
update state is to update the record of the contents of every account — if the contents have 
changed. 

:::

Its main task is to receive blocks that have been executed by the sequencer and use the trace data 
from their execution to update the state of the network. The state manager uses a variation of the 
Merkle tree called a sparse Merkle tree (SMT) to track, manage, and update storage slots representing 
accounts more efficiently. 

It then passes this updated network state information to the [prover](/architecture/stack/trace-expansion-proving/proving) 
in the form of Merkle proofs for submission to Ethereum Mainnet (L1). 

Below, we'll explain the element of Linea's state management in greater detail.

## Merkle trees

### Overview: how Merkle trees work

The Merkle tree and its variations are commonly used across EVM chains for efficient storage and 
retrieval of data about the state of every account on the blockchain. 

A Merkle tree is comprised of 'nodes' that branch off from each other. At the base is the 'root', 
or state root, from which branches stem; and from the branches stem leaves. Each node, regardless 
of type, is represented by a cryptographic hash which encodes data about its properties — for 
example, the contents of your account. 

Each hash encodes the hashes of its child nodes. Taken to its full extent, this cascading system 
means the root encodes data of the state of every single account on the blockchain. 

Cryptographic hashes are deterministic, which means you can reverse the hash function to get the 
data which it encoded. If you have the hash of the root—the only node without a parent—you can 
theoretically derive from it the data of any node in the entire tree. 

As a layer 2 (L2) network, Linea is in the business of making transacting faster and more efficient.
Viewed from this angle, the standard implementation of a Merkle tree, described above, can present
problems. 

A Merkle tree must be computed anew for every single block, accounting for any state changes 
resulting from the transactions included in the block. This can quickly snowball to the point where 
an incredible amount of computation is required to finalize a block. 

### Sparse Merkle trees

Linea's state management uses sparse Merkle trees to minimize computation and contribute to the 
blockchain's efficiency. 

A sparse Merkle tree is a variation of a standard Merkle tree where not all leaf nodes are filled 
with data; instead, data is only stored in nodes where it's needed. It is a complete tree of fixed 
depth, meaning that all branches of the tree have the same length—i.e. the same number of leaves. 

At initialization, all leaf nodes are set to a default value, which is typically a hash of a 
specific value, such as zero. Because all leaf nodes have the same hash value, the parent nodes and 
higher-level nodes also have the same hash value. A node whose hash is the default value for its 
level is therefore considered to represent an _empty_ subtree. 

With this construction, we do not need to keep track of every individual node's hash. Instead, we 
can assume hashes that reflect the default value are empty, and the subtree or node that lies 
further down the chain of nodes can be disregarded; we only need to pay attention to the ones that 
correspond to _non-empty_ subtrees.

## Cryptographic accumulator

A cryptographic accumulator is a type of cryptographic primitive encoding a collection of items into 
very short strings and allowing read/write operations to be proven. Merkle trees and sparse Merkle 
trees are elementary examples of accumulators but there are others with more powerful capabilities.

To fit the EVM requirements, Linea's state manager uses an extended version of a sparse Merkle tree 
that enables it to prove all CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations for a key-addressed 
database. As an outline, the construction uses a sparse Merkle tree to store the nodes of a 
sorted doubly-linked list that encodes all the non-zero items of the state.

The accumulator is used to track the account trie of Linea but also the storage of every contract 
separately.

The leaves of the tree have the following structure: `prev || next || hKey || hVal`.

`hKey` and `hVal` are the hashes of the key and the value of the stored state entry, respectively. 
`prev` and `next` are pointers storing the position of the leaves whose `hKeys` are immediately 
lower and higher, respectively, following lexicographic order. The first two leaves of the SMT are 
called the head and the tail, and are special in that they do not encode a stored tuple. The head is 
the lowest possible `hKey`, while the tail is the highest possible `hKey`. They are therefore 
situated at the beginning and the end of the linked list, respectively. Starting from the head, we 
can access the SMT leaf stored at `head.next` to get the lowest "actually stored" item. Further 
incrementing the `next` value will give us the second-lowest stored item and so on. Repeating the 
process walks us through the entire set of stored items before we end up at the tail node, marking 
the final step.

Leaves can also be referred to as storage slots, in that they contain data about the contents of 
the account in question.

### Tracking empty leaves

As mentioned (above)[#sparse-merkle-trees], all leaves in the tree are populated with default/zero 
values at initialization. Since a deterministic hashing function will ensure that these leaves are 
always represented by the same hash, empty leaves can be easily recognized by the accumulator. 

However, in order for the state manager to update a storage slot with data about a Linea account's 
contents, it must know which empty leaf to overwrite, and exactly where these empty leaves are. A 
further consideration is that we require the index of any 'new' leaf—an empty leaf being updated 
so that it stores data—to be overwritten in a deterministic way. This requirement means that anyone 
can theoretically reconstruct the tree simply by looking at transaction history. 

To ensure consistency in the leaves' position, the state manager only ever inserts 'new' leaves to
the left of the previous leaf in the tree. If this wasn't the case, and the state manager was able
to insert any node in any position, it would be impossible to reconstitute the tree in the exact 
same configuration, severely impacting the ability of L1 to verify the Merkle proof provided.

## Applying the accumulator

The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) uses a variant of a Merkle tree known as a [Merkle-Patricia Trie](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/patricia-merkle-trie/) to track:
- World state, which keeps track of accounts, and;
- Account storage state (or simply 'storage'), which keeps track of the contents of each account. 

On Linea, we adapt this structure, incorporating the custom cryptographic accumulator described 
above.

The accumulator can perform the following operations:
- **Insertion**: adding a new storage slot to the tree, triggered by storing a non-zero value in a 
previously zero-valued slot.
- **Update**: changing the value of an existing storage slot in the tree, triggered by storing a new 
non-zero value in a previously non-zero slot.
- **Deletion**: removing a storage slot from the tree, triggered by storing the zero value in a 
previously non-zero slot.
- **Read zero**: proving non-membership, triggered when a storage slot has been accessed, but not 
updated, and its value is zero.
- **Read non-zero**: proving membership, triggered when a storage slot has been accessed, but not 
updated and its value is non-zero.

These operations are applied to two trees:

### World state

The world state tree maps all accounts that exist on the blockchain—contracts and externally-owned 
accounts (EOAs)—and points towards the account storage state for each. While on Ethereum Mainnet,
this data is stored in a standard trie, Linea uses the the accumulator to map accounts as key:value 
pairs. Otherwise, the implementation is similar to the EVM.

Their structure is as follows:

- `HKey`: Hash(`address`)
- `Val`: Hash(`nonce`, `balance`, `storageRoot`, `codeHash`, `keccakCodeHash`, `CodeSize`)

Critically, every piece of data fed into the `Val` (value) hash function must have a finite field
interpretation. The data must be formatted this way to enable the Linea prover to correctly 
access the world state when verifying proofs. Each element is formatted as follows (all elements
require one field, other than `keccakCodeHash`):

- `nonce`: The nonce is written in big-endian form into a `byte32`. For instance if the nonce is 10,
then the nonce should be encoded as `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a`.
- `balance`: Formatted the same as the nonce; big-endian `byte32`.
- `storageRoot`: The storage root should _not_ be the Keccak of the Patricia trie root as in the 
EVM, but the “custom Merkle tree” root of the account storage state that we describe in the 
[following section](#account-storage-state).
- `codeHash`: The code hash should not be the Keccak of the code, it should instead be the one 
obtained as described in the following section.
- 2 field elements for `keccakCodeHash`: One for the 128 most significant bits and one for the 128 
least significant bits. The Keccak code hash corresponds exactly to the Keccak hash as specified by 
the EVM (i.e. the output of [EXTCODEHASH](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1052). We keep the 
Keccak and the “custom” version for practical reasons.
- `codeSize`: The code size should be the same value as that returned by the CODESIZE/EXTCODESIZE 
opcodes.

### Account storage state

Also referred to as the storage trie, the account storage state is the database the state manager
accesses to retrieve data about the contents of accounts. Account storage is mainly relevant for
contract accounts; for EOAs, the data about assets and transactions is stored in the [world state](#world-state)
`Val`, and the `codeHash` and its variants are empty. 

Since the main function of account storage is to record contracts in such a way that they can be 
easily retrieved and processed, it must efficiently encode the contract. It does this using the 
following format:

- `HKey`: Hash(`StorageKeyMSB`, `StorageKeyLSB`)
- `Val`: Hash(`StorageValueMSB`, `StorageValueLSB`)

In both cases, the `MSB` refers to the first 16 bytes of a 'word', and `LSB` the last 16. 'Word' in
this context refers to the natural unit of data used by the EVM, which is 256-bit (32 byte) chunks. 

For example, if the data regarding a contract's code was encoded in a `byte32`, the standard data
type for words on the EVM and equivalents like Linea, it might look like this:
```
[a0, a1, a2, …., a15, b0, b1, …, b15]
```

That `byte32` would be split into an `MSB` and `LSB` like this:
- `MSB`: `[0, 0, .., 0, a0, a1, a2, a3, .., a15]`
- `LSB`: `[0, 0, .., 0, b0, b1, b2, b3, .., b15]`

The `MSB` takes the first 16 bytes, and the `LSB` the second 16 bytes. 

## Generating state-root-transition witnesses

The accumulator, built using a sparse Merkle tree, is simultaneously: 

- A data structure on which we can perform operations;
- A dataset that we can summarize using a short string at any time (i.e. the root hash);
- A tool that can be used by the Linea protocol to to verify that a given operation triggered a 
transition from hash A to hash B.

Once the accumulator has processed the trace information it receives about a new block and updated
state accordingly, it can pass a new state root hash to the prover, via the coordinator. The state
root hash can then be used by the prover as a "witness": a verifiable method of proving that the
transactions in each block have taken place, without having to divulge the nature of those 
transactions.
