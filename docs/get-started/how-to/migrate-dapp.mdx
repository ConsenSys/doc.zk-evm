title: Migrate a dapp to Linea
description: An overview of the steps to move a dapp from an EVM-compatible chain to Linea.
---

Linea is EVM-equivalent, which means any dapp running on another chain compatible with the 
Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) can run on Linea with no changes. Accordingly, all you'll need to do 
is: 
- Duplicate your existing smart contracts and deploy them on Linea.
- Configure your dapp's backend code to interact with Linea.
- Update your dapp's frontend to display Linea options to users.

## Differences with other EVM-compatible chains

Although Linea's functions under the hood are, naturally, significantly different from Ethereum 
Mainnet and from many other EVM-compatible chains, the differences for builders are intentionally
minimal. However, there are a handful of differences to bear in mind.

These are covered in detail on our [Ethereum differences page](../build/ethereum-differences.mdx). 
In summary:
- Linea uses the [London](https://ethereum.org/en/history/#london) version of the EVM, which means
the availability of some opcodes differs from other chains. 
- Some precompiles behave differently.
- The standard JSON-RPC API is largely the same, but has a few Linea-specific methods and one that
behaves differently from its Ethereum Mainnet equivalent. Notably, we recommend you use 
`linea_estimateGas` for the most accurate gas prices for your users.

[Evmdiff](https://www.evmdiff.com/) is a useful resource for comparing Linea with other chains.

## Deploy smart contracts

Your dapp's existing contracts must be deployed on Linea. [Part one](../build/quickstart/deploy.mdx) 
of our quickstart covers this, or you can pick one of multiple [contract deployment tooling guides](./deploy-smart-contract/index.mdx).

## Configure backend

You'll need to make sure your dapp is configured to interact with Linea. 

### Chain information

You may need to update your dapp with Linea chain information, which our [network information page](../build/network-info.mdx)
covers.

### RPC providers

Most major RPC providers support Linea RPC endpoints. Visit our [RPC providers page](../tooling/node-providers/index.mdx) 
for a non-exhaustive list of public and private endpoints.

:::note
Not all RPC providers support Linea-specific JSON-RPC API methods such as `linea_estimateGas`. The
node providers page details which providers do support these methods.

### Wallet connection

Multiple [libraries](../tooling/libraries), including Wagmi and Viem, support Linea wallet 
connectors. 

Check out our [wallet connection guide](../how-to/connect-wallet.mdx) for additional information.

## Configure frontend

### Linea brand assets

The Linea site has a zip file of official Linea logos and icons [available for download](https://linea.build/assets),
available as both PNGs and SVGs. If you need some assets or media that aren't covered here, please 
reach out on Discord.
