title: Connect a wallet to your dapp
description: Learn how to connect a wallet to your dapp so users can interact with your contracts
---

Enabling users' wallets to connect to your dapp is critical, since it's the only way they can
send transactions and sign messages that enable them to interact with underlying smart contracts. 

In this guide, we'll go through several methods for connecting wallets to a React dapp.

## Wagmi

Wagmi is a library of React hooks for developing dapps that interact with Ethereum-based blockchains
like Linea. 

To get started, install the packages:

```bash
npm install wagmi viem@2.x @tanstack/react-query
```

### Wagmi configuration

Create a file named `wagmi.ts` in your in your project directory, and add this code:

```ts
import { http, createConfig } from 'wagmi'
import { linea, lineaSepolia, mainnet } from 'wagmi/chains'
import { injected } from 'wagmi/connectors'

const projectId = '<WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID>'

export const config = createConfig({
  chains: [lineaSepolia, linea, mainnet],
  connectors: [injected()],
  transports: {
    [lineaSepolia.id]: http(),
    [linea.id]: http(),
    [mainnet.id]: http(),
  },
})
```

This configuration file ensures Wagmi works with Linea, Linea Sepolia, and Ethereum Mainnet, and 
also defines that we should use the `injected` wallet connector, which works with any wallet that
uses the common EIP-1193 standard. There are a few wallets that also have [separate connectors](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/connectors).

### Add Wagmi and query providers

Next, head to your app file. 

Import the the relevant providers from Wagmi and TanStack Query, as well as the `QueryClient` 
function we'll use: 

```tsx
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query'
import { WagmiProvider } from 'wagmi'
import { config } from './wagmi' // path your wagmi.ts config file
```

:::info TanStack Query

TanStack Query, formerly known as React Query, is a library that adds state management for the 
on-chain data your dapp requests from the blockchain using Wagmi hooks. It's not essential, but 
recommended.

:::

Then add the following code, so that your dapp is wrapped within the Wagmi and TanStack Query 
providers:

```tsx
'use client'

import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query'
import { WagmiProvider } from 'wagmi'
import { config } from './wagmi'

const queryClient = new QueryClient()

export default function App() {
  return (
    <WagmiProvider config={config}>
      <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
        <AppContent />
      </QueryClientProvider>
    </WagmiProvider>
  );
}
```

### Add a wallet connection

There are several ways you could use Wagmi to connect wallets. The simplest is to create a wallet
connector component that uses the `useConnect` hook. 

:::tip Multi-wallet discovery 

If you're up for the challenge, and particularly if you're creating a production dapp, we recommend 
you set up your dapp to support EIP-6963, a standard that defines "multi-wallet discovery". In short, 
this means that your dapp can detect the presence of multiple wallets on the user's device and give 
them the choice of which wallet to connect. 

To see how, follow a guide like [this one](https://hackmd.io/@VydelHxmR0CbKxAe4TjhbQ/BJ9Bf4XD6) or 
[this one](https://metamask.io/news/developers/how-to-implement-eip-6963-support-in-your-web3-dapp/).

:::

To proceed with the simpler implementation, we'll create a new component, in a `/components` 
directory if you prefer, and add the below code. We'll call it `ConnectButton.js`, but choose 
whatever filename you like:

```js
import { useConnect } from 'wagmi'
import { injected } from 'wagmi/connectors'

export function ConnectButton() {
  const { connect } = useConnect()

  return (
    <button onClick={() => connect({ connector: injected() })}>
      Connect wallet
    </button>
  )
}
```

The `useConnect` hook is the main object of note here. 

Now that we've defined the component, we can import and insert it into the dapp:

```tsx
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query'
import { WagmiProvider } from 'wagmi'
import { config } from './wagmi'
import { ConnectButton } from '../components/ConnectButton'

const queryClient = new QueryClient()

export default function App() {
  return (
    <WagmiProvider config={config}>
      <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
        <ConnectButton />
      </QueryClientProvider>
    </WagmiProvider>
  );
}
```

Now if you run `npm run dev`, you should be able to connect your wallet, such as MetaMask, on 
Linea, Linea Sepolia, or Ethereum Mainnet.

Note that this is a very basic implementation, with no CSS styling and missing a few other necessary
features, such as displaying the connected wallet's address ([useAccount](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useAccount#address)), 
[connection status](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useConnections), and a [disconnect button](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useDisconnect). 

## Dynamic

Install the Dynamic SDK and the Ethereum connectors:

```bash
npm install @dynamic-labs/sdk-react-core @dynamic-labs/ethereum
```

The latter contains wallet connectors for all chains compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine 
(EVM), Linea included.

### Set up Dynamic dashboard

To properly configure the Dynamic component we're about to use, you need to sign up for Dynamic to
access the [Dynamic dashboard](https://app.dynamic.xyz/).

Once you're in the dashboard, you need to:
1. Enable Linea (and Linea Sepolia, if you need it). [See the guide to configuring your chains](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/chains/enabling-chains).
2. Get the `environmentId` from Developers > SDK & API Keys. 

### Add the provider

To set up the dapp to work with the Dynamic wallet connector button, we need to:
- Wrap dapp contents in the `DynamicContextProvider` component.
- Import the Dynamic Ethereum wallet connectors and pass these to the `DynamicContextProvider` in
its `settings`.

Then, paste the following code into your dapp:

```tsx
import { DynamicContextProvider } from "@dynamic-labs/sdk-react-core";
import { EthereumWalletConnectors } from "@dynamic-labs/ethereum";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <DynamicContextProvider
        settings={{
            environmentId: "YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_ID",
            walletConnectors: [EthereumWalletConnectors]
        }}
    >
      <AppContent />
    </DynamicContextProvider>
  );
}
```

Replace `YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_ID` with the `environmentId` with your own. This enables Dynamic to pull
your configured chains and any other preferences you set up in the dashboard.

:::note

If you intend to use Wagmi in your project, you also need to add a [`DynamicWagmiProvider`](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/react-sdk/providers/dynamicwagmiconnector) 
component and wrap it with [`WagmiProvider`](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/WagmiProvider), like this:

```tsx
<DynamicContextProvider>
    <WagmiProvider>
        <DynamicWagmiProvider>
            <AppContent />
        </DynamicWagmiProvider>
    </WagmiProvider>
</DynamicContextProvider>
```

:::

### Add the component

Next, [select a wallet component](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/react-sdk/components/components-introduction).
For example, you can use the `DynamicWidget` component if you want a wallet connector button that 
you can configure to use various user onboarding methods such as email, phone number, or even
embedded wallets. 

For simplicity, let's go with [`DynamicConnectButton`](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/react-sdk/components/dynamicconnectbutton), 
which is a classic wallet connection button for connecting external wallets. 

Add it to your import statement:

```tsx
import { DynamicContextProvider, DynamicConnectButton } from "@dynamic-labs/sdk-react-core";
```

Then slot it into your dapp, adding some text:

```tsx
import { DynamicContextProvider, DynamicConnectButton } from "@dynamic-labs/sdk-react-core";
import { EthereumWalletConnectors } from "@dynamic-labs/ethereum";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <DynamicContextProvider
        settings={{
            environmentId: "7cc1f95f-6015-4f0b-888d-e52178b1b27d",
                walletConnectors: [EthereumWalletConnectors]
        }}
    >
       <DynamicConnectButton>
          Connect wallet
       </DynamicConnectButton>
    </DynamicContextProvider>
  );
}
```

Now, run your dapp locally and click the button to test your work:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should be able to connect to Linea and Linea Sepolia. 

## Privy

[Privy](https://docs.privy.io/) provides multiple SDKs for building dapps. Their [React SDK](https://docs.privy.io/guide/react/)
is an easy way to get a flexible, configurable wallet connection component into your dapp. 

Install the Privy SDK with this command:

```bash
npm install @privy-io/react-auth@latest
```

### Set up Privy dashboard

[Sign up for Privy](https://dashboard.privy.io/) to access the dashboard.

Go to Login Methods in the sidebar to configure login methods for your dapp, and make sure that 
external wallets are enabled. Optionally, feel free to toggle any other methods you want to use.

Now go to App Settings and get your App ID. We'll need to add this to the dapp code to ensure Privy
functions correctly.

### Add the provider

Now we need to import the Privy provider to the dapp and then use it to wrap the dapp contents:

```tsx
'use client'

import { PrivyProvider } from '@privy-io/react-auth';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <PrivyProvider
    appId="your-privy-app-id" // add your App ID here
    config={{
      appearance: {
        theme: 'dark',
      },
    }}
  >
      <AppContent />
    </PrivyProvider>
  );
}
```

The [`appearance` configuration](https://docs.privy.io/guide/react/configuration/appearance) is 
optional.

### Configure Linea

To enable Privy to use Linea, we need to import it from Viem. First, install Viem with this command:

```bash
npm install viem
```

And then add this import statement to your dapp:

```tsx
import { linea, lineaSepolia } from 'viem/chains'
```

Now we need to add the Linea chains to the `PrivyProvider` `config`:

```tsx
'use client'

import { PrivyProvider } from '@privy-io/react-auth';
import { linea, lineaSepolia } from 'viem/chains'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <PrivyProvider
    appId="cm4tv4knx03yv4baen04ozlhv"
    config={{
      appearance: {
        theme: 'dark',
      },
      defaultChain: linea,
      supportedChains: [linea, lineaSepolia],
    }}
  >
      <AppContent />
    </PrivyProvider>
  );
}
```

We've chosen Linea Mainnet as the `defaultChain`, but you can set this with Linea Sepolia instead,
if you prefer.

### Add the component

To implement the wallet connection button, we'll create a new component that uses the `usePrivy` 
hook, which enables you to trigger the Privy login modal to appear.

Create a new file named `ConnectButton.js` in your `/components` directory, and add the following 
code:

```js
import { usePrivy } from '@privy-io/react-auth';

function ConnectButton() {
  const { login } = usePrivy();

  return (
    <button onClick={login}>
      Connect wallet
    </button>
  );
}
```

Now we can import the component and insert it into the dapp. Ensure your dapp reflects this code:

```tsx
'use client'

import { PrivyProvider } from '@privy-io/react-auth';
import { linea, lineaSepolia } from 'viem/chains'
import { ConnectButton } from '../components/ConnectButton';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <PrivyProvider
    appId="cm4tv4knx03yv4baen04ozlhv"
    config={{
      appearance: {
        theme: 'dark',
      },
      defaultChain: linea,
      supportedChains: [linea, lineaSepolia],
    }}
  >
      <ConnectButton />
    </PrivyProvider>
  );
}
```

Now if you run your dapp with `npm run dev`, the Privy modal will appear when you click the button.
