title: Connect a wallet to your dapp
description: Learn how to connect a wallet to your app so users can interact with your contracts
---

Enabling users' wallets to connect to your dapp is critical, since it's the only way they can
send transacctions and sign messages that enable them to interact with smart contracts underlying
the dapp. 

You can build your own "connect wallet" component or use an SDK that takes care of some of the 
complexity for you.

## Dynamic

Install the Dynamic SDK and the Ethereum connectors:

```bash
npm install @dynamic-labs/sdk-react-core @dynamic-labs/ethereum
```

The latter contains wallet connectors for all chains compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine 
(EVM), Linea included.

### Add the provider

To set up the dapp to work with the Dynamic wallet connector button, we need to:
- Wrap dapp contents in the `DynamicContextProvider` component.
- Import the Dynamic Ethereum wallet connectors and pass these to the `DynamicContextProvider` in
its `settings`.
- Enable Linea (and Linea Sepolia, if you need it) on the [Dynamic dashboard](https://app.dynamic.xyz/).
You need to sign up with Dynamic to do so. [See the guide to configuring your chains](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/chains/enabling-chains). 
- Get the `environmentId` from the [Dynamic dashboard](https://app.dynamic.xyz/) under Developers >
SDK & API Keys. 

Then, paste the following code into your dapp:

```tsx
import { DynamicContextProvider } from "@dynamic-labs/sdk-react-core";
import { EthereumWalletConnectors } from "@dynamic-labs/ethereum";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <DynamicContextProvider
        settings={{
            environmentId: "YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_ID",
            walletConnectors: [EthereumWalletConnectors]
        }}
    >
      <AppContent />
    </DynamicContextProvider>
  );
}
```

Replace `YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_ID` with the `environmentId` with your own.

:::note

If you intend to use Wagmi in your project, you also need to add a [`DynamicWagmiProvider`](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/react-sdk/providers/dynamicwagmiconnector) 
component and wrap it with [`WagmiProvider`](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/WagmiProvider), like this:

```tsx
<DynamicContextProvider>
    <WagmiProvider>
        <DynamicWagmiProvider>
            <AppContent />
        </DynamicWagmiProvider>
    </WagmiProvider>
</DynamicContextProvider>
```

### Add the component

Next, [select a wallet component](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/react-sdk/components/components-introduction).
For example, you can use the `DynamicWidget` component if you want a wallet connector button that 
you can configure to use various user onboarding methods such as email, phone number, or even
embedded wallets. 

For simplicity, let's go with [`DynamicConnectButton`](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/react-sdk/components/dynamicconnectbutton), 
which is a classic wallet connection button. 

Add it to your import statement:

```tsx
import { DynamicContextProvider, DynamicConnectButton } from "@dynamic-labs/sdk-react-core";
```

Then slot it into your dapp, adding some text:

```tsx
import { DynamicContextProvider, DynamicConnectButton } from "@dynamic-labs/sdk-react-core";
import { EthereumWalletConnectors } from "@dynamic-labs/ethereum";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <DynamicContextProvider
        settings={{
            environmentId: "7cc1f95f-6015-4f0b-888d-e52178b1b27d",
                walletConnectors: [EthereumWalletConnectors]
        }}
    >
       <DynamicConnectButton>
          Connect wallet
       </DynamicConnectButton>
    </DynamicContextProvider>
  );
}
```

Now, run your dapp locally and click the button to test your work:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should be able to connect to Linea and Linea Sepolia.
