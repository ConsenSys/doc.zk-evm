title: Connect a wallet to your dapp
description: Learn how to connect a wallet to your app so users can interact with your contracts
---

Enabling users' wallets to connect to your dapp is critical, since it's the only way they can
send transacctions and sign messages that enable them to interact with smart contracts underlying
the dapp. 

You can build your own "connect wallet" component or use an SDK that takes care of some of the 
complexity for you. This guide includes several methods for connecting wallets to a React dapp.

## Dynamic

Install the Dynamic SDK and the Ethereum connectors:

```bash
npm install @dynamic-labs/sdk-react-core @dynamic-labs/ethereum
```

The latter contains wallet connectors for all chains compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine 
(EVM), Linea included.

### Add the provider

To set up the dapp to work with the Dynamic wallet connector button, we need to:
- Wrap dapp contents in the `DynamicContextProvider` component.
- Import the Dynamic Ethereum wallet connectors and pass these to the `DynamicContextProvider` in
its `settings`.
- Enable Linea (and Linea Sepolia, if you need it) on the [Dynamic dashboard](https://app.dynamic.xyz/).
You need to sign up with Dynamic to do so. [See the guide to configuring your chains](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/chains/enabling-chains). 
- Get the `environmentId` from the [Dynamic dashboard](https://app.dynamic.xyz/) under Developers >
SDK & API Keys. 

Then, paste the following code into your dapp:

```tsx
import { DynamicContextProvider } from "@dynamic-labs/sdk-react-core";
import { EthereumWalletConnectors } from "@dynamic-labs/ethereum";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <DynamicContextProvider
        settings={{
            environmentId: "YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_ID",
            walletConnectors: [EthereumWalletConnectors]
        }}
    >
      <AppContent />
    </DynamicContextProvider>
  );
}
```

Replace `YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_ID` with the `environmentId` with your own.

:::note

If you intend to use Wagmi in your project, you also need to add a [`DynamicWagmiProvider`](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/react-sdk/providers/dynamicwagmiconnector) 
component and wrap it with [`WagmiProvider`](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/WagmiProvider), like this:

```tsx
<DynamicContextProvider>
    <WagmiProvider>
        <DynamicWagmiProvider>
            <AppContent />
        </DynamicWagmiProvider>
    </WagmiProvider>
</DynamicContextProvider>
```

### Add the component

Next, [select a wallet component](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/react-sdk/components/components-introduction).
For example, you can use the `DynamicWidget` component if you want a wallet connector button that 
you can configure to use various user onboarding methods such as email, phone number, or even
embedded wallets. 

For simplicity, let's go with [`DynamicConnectButton`](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/react-sdk/components/dynamicconnectbutton), 
which is a classic wallet connection button. 

Add it to your import statement:

```tsx
import { DynamicContextProvider, DynamicConnectButton } from "@dynamic-labs/sdk-react-core";
```

Then slot it into your dapp, adding some text:

```tsx
import { DynamicContextProvider, DynamicConnectButton } from "@dynamic-labs/sdk-react-core";
import { EthereumWalletConnectors } from "@dynamic-labs/ethereum";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <DynamicContextProvider
        settings={{
            environmentId: "7cc1f95f-6015-4f0b-888d-e52178b1b27d",
                walletConnectors: [EthereumWalletConnectors]
        }}
    >
       <DynamicConnectButton>
          Connect wallet
       </DynamicConnectButton>
    </DynamicContextProvider>
  );
}
```

Now, run your dapp locally and click the button to test your work:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should be able to connect to Linea and Linea Sepolia. 


## MetaMask SDK

The [MetaMask SDK](https://docs.metamask.io/wallet/connect/metamask-sdk/) is specifically designed
for connecting directly with MetaMask. 

We're going to use the [React UI variant](https://docs.metamask.io/wallet/connect/metamask-sdk/javascript/react/react-ui/),
which comes with a basic button that you can add to your dapp.  

Firstly, install the SDK: 

```bash
npm install @metamask/sdk-react-ui
```

### Add the provider

To enable the MetaMask SDK to function, you need to wrap your app in the `MetaMaskUIProvider` 
component. For example:

```tsx
import { MetaMaskUIProvider } from "@metamask/sdk-react-ui";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <MetaMaskUIProvider
      sdkOptions={{
        dappMetadata: {
          name: "Your dapp name",
        },
        infuraAPIKey: process.env.INFURA_API_KEY,
        // Add other options here
      }}
    >
        <AppContent />
    </MetaMaskUIProvider>
  );
}
```

Customize the `dappMetadata` according to your needs; this is the information that will be displayed
in the wallet connection modal that users will see. Our usage of `infuraAPIKey` assumes that your
API key is stored in an `.env` file. See the [full list of available `sdkOptions`](https://docs.metamask.io/wallet/reference/sdk-js-options/).

### Add the component

Import the component:

```tsx
import { MetaMaskUIProvider,MetaMaskButton } from "@metamask/sdk-react-ui";
```

Then slot it into your dapp:

```tsx
import { MetaMaskUIProvider, MetaMaskButton } from "@metamask/sdk-react-ui";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <MetaMaskUIProvider
      sdkOptions={{
        dappMetadata: {
          name: "Your dapp name",
        },
        infuraAPIKey: process.env.INFURA_API_KEY,
      }}
    >
        <MetaMaskButton />
    </MetaMaskUIProvider>
  );
}
```

If you run the project, you should be able to see the MetaMask button and be able to connect to
your wallet:

```bash
npm run dev
```
