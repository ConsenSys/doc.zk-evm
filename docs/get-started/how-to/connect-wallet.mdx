title: Connect a wallet to your dapp
description: Learn how to connect a wallet to your app so users can interact with your contracts
---

Enabling users' wallets to connect to your dapp is critical, since it's the only way they can
send transactions and sign messages that enable them to interact with underlying smart contracts. 

In this guide, we'll go through several methods for connecting wallets to a React dapp.

## Wagmi

Wagmi is a library of React hooks for developing apps that interact with Ethereum-based blockchains
like Linea. 

To get started, install the packages:

```bash
npm install wagmi viem@2.x @tanstack/react-query
```

### Wagmi configuration

Create a file named `wagmi.ts` in your in your project directory, and add this code:

```tsx
import { http, createConfig } from 'wagmi'
import { linea, lineaSepolia, mainnet } from 'wagmi/chains'
import { injected } from 'wagmi/connectors'

const projectId = '<WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID>'

export const config = createConfig({
  chains: [lineaSepolia, linea, mainnet],
  connectors: [injected()],
  transports: {
    [lineaSepolia.id]: http(),
    [linea.id]: http(),
    [mainnet.id]: http(),
  },
})
```

This configuration file ensures Wagmi works with Linea, Linea Sepolia, and Ethereum Mainnet, and 
also defines that we should use the `injected` wallet connector, which works with any wallet that
uses the common EIP-1193 standard. There are a few wallets that also have [separate connectors](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/connectors).

### Add Wagmi and query providers

Next, head to your app file. 

Import the the relevant providers from Wagmi and Tanstack Query: 

```tsx
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query'
import { WagmiProvider } from 'wagmi'
import { config } from './wagmi' // path your wagmi.ts config file
```

:::info TanStack Query

TanStack Query, formerly known as React Query, is a library that adds state management for the 
onchain data your app requests from the blockchain using Wagmi hooks. It's not essential, but 
recommended.

:::

Then add the following code, so that your app is wrapped within the Wagmi and Tanstack Query 
providers:

```tsx
'use client'

import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query'
import { WagmiProvider } from 'wagmi'
import { config } from './wagmi'

const queryClient = new QueryClient()

export default function App() {
  return (
    <WagmiProvider config={config}>
      <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
        <AppContent />
      </QueryClientProvider>
    </WagmiProvider>
  );
}
```

### Add a wallet connection

There are several ways you could use Wagmi to connect wallets. The simplest is to create a wallet
connector component that uses the `useConnect` hook. 

:::tip Multi-wallet discovery 

If you're up for the challenge, and particularly if you're creating a production dapp, we recommend 
you set up your dapp to support EIP-6963, a standard that defines "multi-wallet discovery". In short, 
this means that your dapp can detect the presence of multiple wallets on the user's device and give 
them the choice of which wallet to connect. 

To see how, follow a guide like [this one](https://hackmd.io/@VydelHxmR0CbKxAe4TjhbQ/BJ9Bf4XD6) or 
[this one](https://metamask.io/news/developers/how-to-implement-eip-6963-support-in-your-web3-dapp/).

:::

To proceed with the simpler implementation, we'll create a new component, in a `/components` 
directory if you prefer, and add the below code. We'll call it `ConnectButton.js`, but choose 
whatever filename you like:

```js
import { useConnect } from 'wagmi'
import { injected } from 'wagmi/connectors'

export function ConnectButton() {
  const { connect } = useConnect()

  return (
    <button onClick={() => connect({ connector: injected() })}>
      Connect wallet
    </button>
  )
}
```

The `useConnect` hook is the main object of note here. 

Now that we've defined the component, we can insert it into the dapp:

```tsx
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query'
import { WagmiProvider } from 'wagmi'
import { config } from './wagmi'
import { ConnectButton } from '../components/ConnectButton'

const queryClient = new QueryClient()

export default function App() {
  return (
    <WagmiProvider config={config}>
      <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
        <ConnectButton />
      </QueryClientProvider>
    </WagmiProvider>
  );
}
```

Now if you run `npm run dev`, you should be able to connect your wallet, such as MetaMask, on 
Linea, Linea Sepolia, or Ethereum Mainnet.

Note that this is a very basic implementation, with no CSS styling and missing a few other necessary
features, such as displaying the connected wallet's address ([useAccount](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useAccount#address)), 
[connection status](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useConnections), and a [disconnect button](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useDisconnect). 

## Dynamic

Install the Dynamic SDK and the Ethereum connectors:

```bash
npm install @dynamic-labs/sdk-react-core @dynamic-labs/ethereum
```

The latter contains wallet connectors for all chains compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine 
(EVM), Linea included.

### Add the provider

To set up the dapp to work with the Dynamic wallet connector button, we need to:
- Wrap dapp contents in the `DynamicContextProvider` component.
- Import the Dynamic Ethereum wallet connectors and pass these to the `DynamicContextProvider` in
its `settings`.
- Enable Linea (and Linea Sepolia, if you need it) on the [Dynamic dashboard](https://app.dynamic.xyz/).
You need to sign up with Dynamic to do so. [See the guide to configuring your chains](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/chains/enabling-chains). 
- Get the `environmentId` from the [Dynamic dashboard](https://app.dynamic.xyz/) under Developers >
SDK & API Keys. 

Then, paste the following code into your dapp:

```tsx
import { DynamicContextProvider } from "@dynamic-labs/sdk-react-core";
import { EthereumWalletConnectors } from "@dynamic-labs/ethereum";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <DynamicContextProvider
        settings={{
            environmentId: "YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_ID",
            walletConnectors: [EthereumWalletConnectors]
        }}
    >
      <AppContent />
    </DynamicContextProvider>
  );
}
```

Replace `YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_ID` with the `environmentId` with your own.

:::note

If you intend to use Wagmi in your project, you also need to add a [`DynamicWagmiProvider`](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/react-sdk/providers/dynamicwagmiconnector) 
component and wrap it with [`WagmiProvider`](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/WagmiProvider), like this:

```tsx
<DynamicContextProvider>
    <WagmiProvider>
        <DynamicWagmiProvider>
            <AppContent />
        </DynamicWagmiProvider>
    </WagmiProvider>
</DynamicContextProvider>
```

:::

### Add the component

Next, [select a wallet component](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/react-sdk/components/components-introduction).
For example, you can use the `DynamicWidget` component if you want a wallet connector button that 
you can configure to use various user onboarding methods such as email, phone number, or even
embedded wallets. 

For simplicity, let's go with [`DynamicConnectButton`](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/react-sdk/components/dynamicconnectbutton), 
which is a classic wallet connection button. 

Add it to your import statement:

```tsx
import { DynamicContextProvider, DynamicConnectButton } from "@dynamic-labs/sdk-react-core";
```

Then slot it into your dapp, adding some text:

```tsx
import { DynamicContextProvider, DynamicConnectButton } from "@dynamic-labs/sdk-react-core";
import { EthereumWalletConnectors } from "@dynamic-labs/ethereum";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <DynamicContextProvider
        settings={{
            environmentId: "7cc1f95f-6015-4f0b-888d-e52178b1b27d",
                walletConnectors: [EthereumWalletConnectors]
        }}
    >
       <DynamicConnectButton>
          Connect wallet
       </DynamicConnectButton>
    </DynamicContextProvider>
  );
}
```

Now, run your dapp locally and click the button to test your work:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should be able to connect to Linea and Linea Sepolia.
