description: Learn how to get testnet ETH for Linea Sepolia.
---

To get started with building on Linea you'll need some Linea Sepolia ETH. The most efficient method
is to use one the many available faucets to drip testnet ETH directly to your chosen account.

## MetaMask faucet

We recommend you use the [MetaMask faucet](https://docs.metamask.io/developer-tools/faucet/). It
supports using Linea ENS names, and using one guarantees you'll receive the full 0.5 ETH daily 
maximum.

See our [support guide to getting a Linea ENS name](https://support.linea.build/explore/ens).

## Get testnet ERC-20 tokens

Testnet ERC-20 tokens may be useful for development purposes.

One method is to use the [OKX faucet](https://www.okx.com/xlayer/faucet/sepoliafaucet), which 
enables you to select from a handful of different testnet ERC-20 tokens.
