# Fund your wallet

Use [MetaMask](https://docs.metamask.io/guide/getting-started.html) to store your funds and interact with the
ConsenSys zkEVM network. You can [install MetaMask as a browser extension or mobile app](https://metamask.io/download/).

You need to [bridge Goerli ETH to the ConsenSys zkEVM network](bridge-funds.md) to interact with the network.

Use a faucet to obtain Goerli ETH. Transactions are much cheaper than Mainnet, therefore 0.1 ETH is enough
to execute a basic workflow. You can [view a list of faucets](https://faucetlink.to/goerli)
for the Goerli network.

To obtain test USDC on Goerli, use the [USDC faucet](https://bridge.goerli.zkevm.consensys.net/faucet?token=USDC)
using our bridge to mint 10 USDC. You must have some Goerli test ETH to pay for the transaction to mint USDC.
