# Onboarding process

To ensure the system is secure and stable, we are gradually onboarding new users each day in the order users signed up to the waitlist. The number of users onboarded per day will vary depending on activity. We hope to onboard everyone who signed up as quick as possible.

When you signed up you should receive an email from Infura.

If you are an existing Infura user, you will see an email with the subject header: Congratulations you are on the ConsenSys zkEVM private beta waitlist.

If you do not receive an email it could be that you have opted out of email communications. You can check if you opted-out of emails when you enter your email into the waitlist form [here](https://www.infura.io/resources/network/consensys-zkevm-beta-signup). A blue warning will appear saying "LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE OPTED OUT OF EMAIL COMMUNICATION. CLICK HERE TO GET AN EMAIL AND OPT BACK IN." if you have opted out. Click the link to opt back-in.

If you not a registered Infura user, you will see an email with the subject header: Steps required to participate in the ConsenSys zkEVM private beta.

You must create a free Infura account to be eligible for testing the Consensys zkEVM. Once this is complete, you will be ready to be onboarded.

Once your account has been whitelisted you should receive an email with the subject header: ConsenSys zkEVM private beta endpoints are now live

This email provides instructions on how to access your unique RPC URL which can be used in the setup guide on our [website](https://goerli.zkevm.consensys.net/) to configure your Metamask and begin testing the network.

!!! note

    Currently, it is recommended that you test the zkEVM on a desktop browser rather than tablet or mobile.
