# Onboarding process

To ensure the system is secure and stable, we are gradually onboarding new users in the order
signed up to the waiting list. The number of daily onboarded users vary depending on activity.
We hope to onboard everyone who signed up as quick as possible.

You'll receive an email from Infura when you sign up. If you are an existing Infura user, you'll
receive an email confirming that you are on the waiting list.

!!! important

    If you do not receive an email, it could be that you opted out of email communications. You can
    check if you opted-out by entering your email into the
    [waiting list form](https://www.infura.io/resources/network/consensys-zkevm-beta-signup). A blue warning will appear
    saying, "LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE OPTED OUT OF EMAIL COMMUNICATION. CLICK HERE TO GET AN EMAIL AND OPT BACK IN".
    Click the link to opt back-in.

If you're not a registered Infura user, you'll receive an email with the steps required to
participate in the ConsenSys zkEVM private beta. You must create a free Infura account to be eligible
for testing ConsenSys zkEVM. Once this is complete, you'll be ready for the onboarding process.

Onboarded users will receive an email with instructions to access the unique
RPC URL in Infura to configure MetaMask and begin testing the network. You can follow the testing environment
setup on our [website](https://goerli.zkevm.consensys.net/).

!!! note

    We recommended testing ConsenSys zkEVM on a desktop browser rather than tablet or mobile.
