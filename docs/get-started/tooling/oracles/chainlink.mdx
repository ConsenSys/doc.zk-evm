Chainlink is the industry standard for building, accessing, and selling oracle
services needed to power hybrid smart contracts on any blockchain. Chainlink
oracle networks enable smart contracts to connect to any external API and
leverage secure offchain computations for feature-rich applications. Chainlink
currently secures tens of billions of dollars across DeFi, insurance, gaming,
and other major industries, and offers global enterprises and leading data
providers a universal gateway to all blockchains.
