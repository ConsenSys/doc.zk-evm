[DipDup](https://dipdup.io/) is a Python framework for building smart contract
indexers. It helps developers focus on business logic instead of writing a
boilerplate to store and serve data. DipDup-based indexers are selective, which
means only required data is requested. This approach allows to achieve faster
indexing times and decreased load on underlying APIs.

## Understanding DipDup

DipDup is a software framework that helps web3 developers create selective
indexers for decentralized applications. It uses blockchain data provided by
various off-chain data sources. Some of the key features of DipDup include:

- **Ready for multichain**: DipDup supports dozens of blockchains, and we are
  constantly adding new ones. You can easily reuse your business logic for
  different networks or even index multiple chains in a single project.
- **Declarative configuration**: A whole indexer is defined by a single
  configuration file and a bunch of Python data handlers. Code is completely
  separated from the configuration and environment variables, making it easy to
  maintain and deploy your project.
- **Integrations**: You can use SQLite, PostgreSQL, or TimescaleDB databases to
  store blockchain data, deploy to Compose or Swarm with a single command,
  monitor your indexer with Prometheus or Sentry, and more.
- **GraphQL API**: DipDup automatically generates a GraphQL API for your data
  using Hasura, so you can query it from your frontend or other services. You
  can extend the API with custom queries and metadata requests.
- **CLI**: DipDup CLI has everything you need to conveniently manage your
  project, from creating a new one to running and deploying. There are lots of
  templates for various blockchains and use cases, so you can start quickly.
