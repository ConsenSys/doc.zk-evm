[Scamfari](https://scamfari.com) is a cybersecurity tool developed on the Linea blockchain, enabling 
users to report suspicious activities linked to malicious actors within the blockchain space. These 
malicious entities - including scammers and phishers â€” pose ongoing challenges in the blockchain 
community. Scamfari's approach involves thorough reviews of each user-submitted report by 
cybersecurity professionals to ensure the data's accuracy. Verified reports are subsequently 
integrated into various databases, notably the [HAPI Protocol](https://hapi.one), fortifying the 
collective defense against such threats.
