Pimlico provides smart account tools for ERC-4337 that streamline development.

The core services provided by ERC-4337 at the infrastructure level are:

1. A single entry point contract
2. A bundler (network) to bundle `UserOps`
3. An optional paymaster service

[The Pimlico docs](https://docs.pimlico.io/docs) will help you get started by deploying a wallet on 
Linea on top of Pimlico and submitting your first `UserOperation`.
