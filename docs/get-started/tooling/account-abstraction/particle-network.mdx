## Smart Wallet-as-a-Service

[Particle Network](https://particle.network)'s Wallet Abstraction services enable universal, 
web2-adjacent onboarding and interactions. Its core technology, [Smart Wallet-as-a-Service](https://blog.particle.network/announcing-our-smart-wallet-as-a-service-modular-stack-upgrading-waas-with-erc-4337) 
(WaaS) onboards users into multi-party computation (MPC)-secured smart accounts supporting any chain. 
It also allows developers to improve user experience through modular, fully customizable EOA/AA 
embedded wallets. Particle supports its Smart Wallet-as-a-Service through a modular L1 that powers 
chain abstraction, acting as a settlement layer across chains for a seamless multi-chain experience.

Smart Wallet-as-a-Service is compatible with Linea using EOAs (traditional accounts) and AA (smart 
accounts). This AA support extends to Particle Network's [Bundler](https://developers.particle.network/docs/bundler) 
and [Omnichain Paymaster](https://developers.particle.network/docs/paymaster) infrastructure, both 
of which are compatible with Linea.

Developers can leverage Particle Network to onboard users into smart accounts using social login, 
then facilitate full-stack ERC-4337 account abstraction through [native AA SDKs](https://developers.particle.network/docs/aa-web-quickstart), 
available across six platforms.
