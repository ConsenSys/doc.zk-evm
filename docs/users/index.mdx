Linea is an Ethereum layer 2 (L2) network that provides access to innovative Web3
projects at significantly lower costs compared to Ethereum. It's compatible with the
Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), allowing users to deploy existing Ethereum applications and
develop new ones that would be too costly on Mainnet. It also enables the community to
use those dapps, **at a fraction of the cost**, and at **multiples the speed** of Mainnet.

Linea delivers unrivaled network security with its cryptographically secure zk-rollup infrastructure,
comprehensive security partnerships, and security-oriented ecosystem culture. View the
[Linea architecture](../architecture/index.mdx) for more information.

You can get started by [funding your Linea account](./move-funds/index.mdx) using the
fiat onramp in MetaMask Portfolio or by bridging over funds.
