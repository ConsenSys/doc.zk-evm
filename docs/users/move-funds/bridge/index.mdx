The [official Linea bridge page](https://bridge.linea.build/) provides muliple options to bridge
your funds to Linea.

You can select the option most appropriate to you:

- **MetaMask bridge for users** - The bridge feature in MetaMask Portfolio, which we recommend as
    the simplest option for most users.
- **Third-party bridges for users** - Use alternative third-party bridges. 
- **Native bridge for tech operators** - Best suited for tech operators, dapp teams, and liquidity 
providers. For more guidance on the native bridge, see [here](bridge/how-to-bridge-eth).

## Use the MetaMask bridge

The MetaMask Portfolio's bridge surveys bridges across Linea to source its routes and rates and provides
you with the best price.

MetaMask Portfolio's bridge also allows you to bridge and swap tokens as part of the same transaction.

## Third-party bridges

You can find third-party bridges on the [ecosystem portal](https://linea.build/apps). Use the
filter to find the available third-party bridges.

:::caution

These are permissionless bridges, and, you should do your own research before interacting
with dapps in order to keep your funds safe.
