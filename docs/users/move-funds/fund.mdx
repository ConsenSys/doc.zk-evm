Linea uses ETH for network transactions fees. You can fund your account on either the [Linea Mainnet](#linea-mainnet) for
real transactions or [Linea Sepolia](#linea-sepolia) for testing purposes.

:::warning

Linea Goerli will soon be deprecated. We recommend you use Linea Sepolia for any testnet activities.

:::

## Linea Mainnet

You can buy tokens directly on Linea using [MetaMask Portfolio](https://portfolio.metamask.io/).
Alternatively, if you already have tokens on another network, you can [bridge them to Linea](./bridge.mdx).
For example you can bridge ETH on the Ethereum network over to the Linea network.

:::info
The [MetaMask Portfolio](https://portfolio.metamask.io/) dapp allows you to buy, sell, swap, stake, bridge, and
manage your cryptoassets, among other features.

Linea purchases in MetaMask Portfolio are available worldwide.

### Buy tokens on Linea Mainnet

To buy tokens using MetaMask Portfolio:

1. Access [MetaMask Portfolio](https://portfolio.metamask.io), and connect the account that will
    receive your purchased tokens.
1. Select the option to buy tokens:
    - On a mobile device, select **Buy** from the hamburger icon menu located in the top left 
        of the screen.
    - On a desktop, select **Buy** on screen.

        :::info
        If you've never used the **Buy** option previously, you'll first need to 
        select your region because payment methods and provider availability vary based on your bank's location.
        :::

1. Set the payment method, if you've bought tokens before on your current device, your 
    previous choice is loaded by default.
1. In the **Buy** menu, select the token, and locate and select **Linea** from the networks list.
1. In the list of tokens available to buy on Linea, select the one you want to buy.
1. On the main screen, input the amount you wish to spend.
1. View your quotes:
    - On a desktop browser, one or more quotes appear on the right.
    - On mobile devices, select **Get Quotes**.
1. Pick a quote by selecting it.

Selecting a quote redirects you to the provider's site to complete the transaction. You may need 
to complete KYC ("Know Your Customer"; essentially, identifying yourself) with the provider.

After you've completed the steps with the provider, you'll be routed back to MetaMask Portfolio. 
Timescales for receiving your funds vary based on the provider and token route.
