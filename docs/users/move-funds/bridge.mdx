{/* 
The [official Linea bridge](https://bridge.linea.build/) provides multiple options to bridge
your funds to Linea.

You can select the option most appropriate to you:

- **MetaMask bridge for users** - The bridge feature in MetaMask Portfolio, which we recommend as
    the simplest option for most users.
- **Third-party bridges for users** - Use alternative third-party bridges. 
- **Linea Native Bridge** - Best suited for tech operators, dapp teams, and liquidity 
providers. For more guidance on the native bridge, see [here](../../developers/guides/bridge/how-to-bridge-eth.mdx).

:::info
The Linea Native Bridge is a slower option that should not be used for time-sensitive transfers.
Additionally, you will need to manually claim ERC-20 tokens that are transferred across using this bridge.
:::

## Use the MetaMask Portfolio bridge

The [MetaMask Portfolio's bridge](https://portfolio.metamask.io/bridge) surveys bridges across Linea to
source its routes and rates and provides you with the best price.

MetaMask Portfolio's bridge also allows you to bridge and swap tokens as part of the same transaction.

[View the MetaMask Portfolio's bridge documentation](https://support.metamask.io/metamask-portfolio/bridge/)
for more information. 

## Third-party bridges

You can find third-party bridges on the [ecosystem portal](https://linea.build/apps). Use the
filter to find the available third-party bridges.

:::caution

These are permissionless bridges, and, you should do your own research before interacting
with dapps in order to keep your funds safe.
