# Use Docker

You can use Docker to run [Hyperledger Besu](https://besu.hyperledger.org/) or [Geth](https://geth.ethereum.org/) as
a Linea node on the mainnet or testnet. 

## Prerequisites

Download and install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

## Run a Besu node

:::info

The Besu Docker image does not run on Windows.

:::

### Step 1. Download configurations files

Download the configuration files for the relevant network (in Zip format). The configuration files include the network genesis file,
Docker Compose file and client configuration file.

<Tabs groupId="networks" className="my-tabs">
  <TabItem value="mainnet" label="Mainnet">
  
  Download the [besu-mainnet zip file](/files/besu/besu-mainnet.zip).
  
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="testnet" label="Testnet">
  
  Download the [besu-goerli zip file](/files/besu/besu-goerli.zip).
  
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Step 2. Update the client configuration file

Update the client configuration file with the your IP address and data path directory.

<Tabs groupId="networks" className="my-tabs">
  <TabItem value="mainnet" label="Mainnet">
  
  In the `config-snap-mainnet.toml` file, change the `p2p-host="Your IP Address"` to your own public IP address and change
  the `data-path=”besu-mainnet”` to your specific folder name where you’re running the node from.
  
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="testnet" label="Testnet">
  
  In the `config-snap-goerli.toml` file, change the `p2p-host="Your IP Address"` to your own public IP address and
  change `data-path=”besu-mainnet”` to your specific folder name where you’re running the node from.
  
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip

You can use [this page](https://www.whatismyip.com/) to find your IP address.

:::

### Step 3. Update the `docker-compose` file

In the `docker-compose.yaml` file, edit the volumes section by changing the `/path/to/your/[NETWORK]/directory` to the
data path of the folder where you are hosting the files.

### Step 4. Start the Besu node

Open a terminal in the directory location and run `docker-compose up`. 

:::note

It can take up to 20 minutes for the node to find peers. If it takes any longer than that, try restarting the node. For
more information please look at the official [Besu documentation](https://besu.hyperledger.org/public-networks/get-started/install/run-docker-image).

## Run a Geth node

### Step 1. Download configurations files

Download the configuration files for the relevant network. Ensure that you download the files to the same directory.

<Tabs groupId="networks" className="my-tabs">
  <TabItem value="mainnet" label="Mainnet">
  
  Download the mainnet [`docker-compose.yml`](pathname:///files/docker-compose.yml) and [`genesis.json`](pathname:///files/genesis.json)
  files.
  
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="testnet" label="Testnet">
  
  Download the testnet [`docker-compose.yml`](pathname:///files//testnet/docker-compose.yml) and [`genesis.json`](pathname:///files/testnet/genesis.json)
  files.
  
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Step 2. Start the Geth node

Open up a terminal where the both `docker-compose.yml` and `genesis.json` are located (they should be in the same directory)
and run `docker compose up`

The node should now be running and looking for peers to sync.

:::note

You can ignore log messages related to Besu. The `docker-compose.yml` has Besu configurations that won't be running and
shouldn't affect your node.
