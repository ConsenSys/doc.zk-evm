# Use Docker

You can use Docker to run [Hyperledger Besu](https://besu.hyperledger.org/) or [Geth](https://geth.ethereum.org/) as
a Linea node on the mainnet or testnet. 

## Prerequisites

Download and install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

## Run a Besu node

:::info

The Besu Docker image does not run on Windows.

:::

### Step 1. Download configurations files

Download the configuration files for the relevant network (in ZIP format). The configuration files include the network genesis file,
Docker Compose file and Besu configuration file.

<Tabs groupId="networks" className="my-tabs">
  <TabItem value="mainnet" label="Mainnet">
  
  Download the mainnet [`besu-mainnet` ZIP file](/files/besu/besu-mainnet.zip).
  
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="testnet" label="Testnet">
  
  Download the testnet [`besu-goerli` ZIP file](/files/besu/besu-goerli.zip).
  
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Step 2. Update the Docker Compose file

In the `docker-compose.yaml` file, edit the volumes section by changing `/path/to/your/directory` to the
data path of the folder where you are hosting the files. For example:

<Tabs groupId="networks" className="my-tabs">
  <TabItem value="mainnet" label="Mainnet">
  
  ```yaml
  volumes:
    - /Users/myuser/besu-mainnet:/config
  ```
  
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="testnet" label="Testnet">
  
  ```yaml
  volumes:
    - /Users/myuser/besu-goerli:/config
  ```
  
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The folder where you are hosting the files will be mounted to the `/config` folder inside the Docker container.

### Step 3. Update the client configuration file

Update the Besu configuration file (`config-snap-[NETWORK].toml`) with your IP public address. To do this, set
the `p2p-host="Your IP Address"` option.

Refer to the [Besu documentation](https://besu.hyperledger.org/public-networks/reference/cli/options#p2p-host) for more
information about the `p2p-host` option.

:::tip

You can use [this page](https://www.whatismyip.com/) to find your public IP address.

:::

### Step 4. Start the Besu node

Open a terminal in the directory location containing the configuration files and run `docker-compose up`. 

It can take up to 20 minutes for the node to find peers. If it takes any longer than that, try restarting the node.

:::tip Toubleshoot peering issues

Refer to the [Besu troubleshooting information](https://besu.hyperledger.org/public-networks/how-to/troubleshoot/peering)
for help if you experience peering issues.

## Run a Geth node

### Step 1. Download configurations files

Download the configuration files for the relevant network. Ensure that you download the files to the same directory.

<Tabs groupId="networks" className="my-tabs">
  <TabItem value="mainnet" label="Mainnet">
  
  Download the mainnet [`docker-compose.yml`](pathname:///files/docker-compose.yml) and [`genesis.json`](pathname:///files/genesis.json)
  files.
  
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="testnet" label="Testnet">
  
  Download the testnet [`docker-compose.yml`](pathname:///files//testnet/docker-compose.yml) and [`genesis.json`](pathname:///files/testnet/genesis.json)
  files.
  
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Step 2. Start the Geth node

Open up a terminal where the both `docker-compose.yml` and `genesis.json` are located (they should be in the same directory)
and run `docker compose up`

The node should now be running and looking for peers to sync.

:::note

You can ignore log messages related to Besu. The `docker-compose.yml` has Besu configurations that won't be running and
shouldn't affect your node.

:::

## Confirm the node is running

You can call the JSON-RPC API methods to confirm the node is running. For example, call `eth_syncing` to return the
starting, current, and highest block.

```bash

curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_syncing","params":[],"id":1}' localhost:8545

```

You should get a result, similar to:

```bash
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "startingBlock": "0x0",
    "currentBlock": "0x2d0",
    "highestBlock": "0x66c0"
  }
}
```
