# Use Docker

You can use Docker to run [Hyperledger Besu](https://besu.hyperledger.org/) or [Geth](https://geth.ethereum.org/) as
a Linea node on the mainnet or testnet. 

:::warning Important

The Besu Docker image does not run on Windows.

:::

## Prerequisites

Download and install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

## Run a Besu node

### Step 1. Download configuration files

Download the configuration files for the relevant network (in ZIP format) and extract them. The configuration
files include the network genesis file, Docker Compose file and Besu configuration file.

<Tabs groupId="networks" className="my-tabs">
  <TabItem value="mainnet" label="Mainnet">
  
  Download the mainnet [`besu-mainnet` ZIP file](pathname:///files/besu/besu-mainnet.zip).
  
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="testnet" label="Testnet">
  
  Download the testnet [`besu-goerli` ZIP file](pathname:///files/besu/besu-goerli.zip).
  
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Step 2. Update the Docker Compose file

In the `docker-compose.yaml` file, update the `--p2p-host` command to include your public IP address. For example:

```yaml
--p2p-host=103.10.10.10
```

:::tip

You can use [this page](https://www.whatismyip.com/) to find your public IP address.

:::

### Step 3. Start the Besu node

Open a terminal, in the directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` file, run `docker-compose up`. 

It can take up to 20 minutes for the node to find peers. If it takes any longer than that, try restarting the node.

:::tip Troubleshoot peering issues

Refer to the [Besu troubleshooting information](https://besu.hyperledger.org/public-networks/how-to/troubleshoot/peering)
for help if you experience peering issues.

## Run a Geth node

### Step 1. Download configuration files

Download the configuration files for the relevant network. Ensure that you download the files to the same directory.

<Tabs groupId="networks" className="my-tabs">
  <TabItem value="mainnet" label="Mainnet">
  
  Download the mainnet [`docker-compose.yml`](pathname:///files/docker-compose.yml) and [`genesis.json`](pathname:///files/genesis.json)
  files.
  
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="testnet" label="Testnet">
  
  Download the testnet [`docker-compose.yml`](pathname:///files//testnet/docker-compose.yml) and [`genesis.json`](pathname:///files/testnet/genesis.json)
  files.
  
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Step 2. Start the Geth node

Open up a terminal where the both `docker-compose.yml` and `genesis.json` are located (they should be in the same directory)
and run `docker compose up`

The node should now be running and looking for peers to sync.

## Confirm the node is running

You can call the JSON-RPC API methods to confirm the node is running. For example, call
[`eth_syncing`](https://besu.hyperledger.org/public-networks/reference/api#eth_syncing) to return the synchronization status.
For example the starting, current, and highest block, or `false` if not synchronizing (or if the head of the chain has been reached).

```bash

curl localhost:8545 \
        -X POST \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_syncing","params":[],"id":1}'

```

You should get a result, similar to:

```bash
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "startingBlock": "0x0",
    "currentBlock": "0x5d228",
    "highestBlock": "0x3cedec"
  }
}
```
