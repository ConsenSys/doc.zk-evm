### Summary

This release focuses on reducing L1 costs, enabling lower prices for end users.

Primarily, the L1 costs are driven by the following:

- Proof verification, which is essentially a fixed cost for every batch submission.

- Hashing the batch submission data to produce the public input of the Plonk verifier.

- Calldata costs, driven by the size of the batch submission data. This includes all the transaction data from L2, as well as messaging data (one hash per L2 to L1 message).

### Features

To decrease L1 costs, we implemented the following features:

- Proof aggregation:
  - This allows us to create a set of execution proofs for conflated batches and generates an aggregated proof that verifies that all the batches are correct. Since it takes the same amount of gas to verify an aggregated proof vs. a proof for a single batch of conflated blocks, the average cost of verifying a proof aggregating N proofs is N times cheaper.
- Data compression:
  - This reduces the call data cost on L1 by compressing L2 block data. (Post EIP-4844 this will be stored in blobs)
- Switched L2 to L1 messaging anchoring from individual hashes to Merkle trees:
  - Due to the size of the Merkle trees (32 messages) requiring only one Merkle root to be anchored, there is a 32x calldata size reduction for message hashes

### Smart contract changes

To support these new features, we implemented changes to our smart contracts. 

We introduce a `VERIFIER_SETTER_ROLE`, that will be attributed to the Timelock.sol so that all core contract upgrades (Rollup and Message and Token bridge) and verifiers are executed through a TimeLock mechanism.
Note that we are also using this upgrade to update the way the type 2 state was calculated; as such we'll need to call `finalizeWithoutProof` to perform a state transition from type2 state v1 to type2 state v2.

The Security Council will first execute the following transactions on L1:
- Assign Operator Role via the Safe to the account for blob submission
- Assign Verifier Setter role via the Safe to the Timelock
- Schedule Set new Verifier at index 0
- Execute Set new Verifier at index 0
- Schedule LineaRollup upgrade (at L1 block N)
- Execute LineaRollup upgrade (at L1 block N)
- Update Zodiac delegate roles from pauseByType(bytes32) -> pauseByType(uint8)

The Security Council will then execute the following transactions on L2:
- Schedule L2MessageService upgrade
- Execute L2MessageService upgrade

Post upgrade, Execute the following Security Council transactions on L1:
- Call FinalizeWithoutProof
- Clear verifier mapping at index 6 and 7

- Open Zeppelin: https://blog.openzeppelin.com/linea-v2-audit

### Breaking changes

**Message claiming**

- Parties claiming messages on Layer 1 will need to adjust claiming behavior to account for Merkle Proof generation requests and their submission when claiming a message. This applies to messages sent post upgrading. Pre-existing messages must be claimed with the current approach.

:::info[Note] 

<!-- markdown-link-check-disable-next-line -->
If you are using the Linea Bridge UI, then this is already done for you. If you are a partner/user who manages their claiming outside of the Bridge UI, then we recommend looking at the updated [SDK](/build-on-linea/linea-sdk/index.md).

:::

**Finalization events**

- After migration to the new finalization mechanism, the rollup contract will no longer emit finalization events per block, but will instead emit events for data submission as well as an event indicating the current point of finalization.
  - The calldata will contain only the final block state root hash and final block number.

:::info[Note] 

This is a breaking change for consumers listening to the existing events. The `BlockFinalized` event will be replaced by the `DataFinalized` event.

- Updated default `gasPrice` to 3 Gwei

## October 2023

### October 23

## Summary release notes (June - October)

### Performance improvements

- Changes to the Genesis File: We made changes to the genesis file to enable block times to be reduced. This enhancement improves the overall performance and throughput of Linea.

- Improved Gas Limit Estimation for Finalization on L1: We improved the gas limit estimation for finalization on L1.

### Cost efficiency

- We updated the L1 message service contract to work with the Merkle tree, reducing gas costs and further enhancing the cost-effectiveness of Linea.

- We added a fixed cost to the gas price to cover infrastructure costs for system economic sustainability. This change ensures the long-term financial viability of Linea.

### User experience

- We smoothed the L2 gas price estimation by using an L1 moving average. This update makes our gas price estimation more accurate and reliable.

## Linea Alpha v0.2.3 (June 22, 2023)

### Summary

This release focuses on optimizing the prover's hashing strategy to increase its computational efficiency.

## Linea Alpha v0.2.2 (June 20, 2023)

### Summary

This release focuses on updating the Postman SDK configuration values and revising gas fee calculations.

### Features

- Updated the Postman SDK configuration files to handle messages that are contract calls with zero ETH value being transferred and revised gas fee calculations.

## Linea Alpha v0.2.1 (June 15, 2023)

### Summary

This release reduces the gas cost of submitting a batch of transactions on L1 by optimizing L2 logs in the calldata that is sent to L1.

### Features

- Instead of sending the entire event MessageSent, we only send the \_messageHash field of the event.

- **Old calldata for L2 originated event**:

  ```bash
  //		event MessageSent(
  //			address indexed _from,
  //			address indexed _to,
  //			uint256 _fee,
  //			uint256 _value,
  //			uint256 _salt,
  //			bytes _calldata,
  //			bytes32 _messageHash
  //	    );
  ```

- **New calldata for L2 originated event**:
  ```bash
    //			bytes32 _messageHash
  ```

## Linea Alpha v0.2.0 (June 13, 2023)

### Summary

This release focuses on testing a substantial architecture upgrade in preparation for Mainnet launch. It contains multiple improvements and breaking changes, specifically around the messaging layer which is changed to a push model. It also improves EVM prover coverage, and provides batch conflation.

### Features

- Add Batch Conflation feature to the sequencer to minimize L1 transactions cost.
  - With Batch Conflation, L2 blocks' proofs that should have been independent are instead merged together. Therefore, L1 costs for these blocks’ proofs are divided by the number of merged blocks.
- Improve the following smart contracts:
  - Rollup zkEVM: Upgrade the rollup main contract with support for
    - Conflation
    - Security Council management
    - Verifier
      - Outer proof system moved from Groth16 to Plonk + custom gates to support efficient Fiat Shamir, c.f.: https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1072.pdf section 6.2
    - Messaging Service
      - Changed the message service model by splitting the delivery into anchoring and claiming of messages to allow more flexible workflows, remove the mandatory fee for L1→L2, reduce the mandatory fee for L2→L1
  - Canonical Token Bridge: Upgrade from 1-1 ERC-20 basic token bridge to N-N ERC-20 canonical token bridge with reservation and token registry
- Add Postman Service for message execution
  - The Postman Service is Linea’s off-chain message delivery service. It’s decentralized, permissionless, and used to claim messages once the protocol has anchored the message hashes. The first release will only contain the following scenarios:
    - DApps/protocols operating the SDK (to be released) claiming messages and paying for gas
      - The protocol can filter messages based on origin or destination smart-contracts
    - Linea operating the SDK for dApps/Protocols that aren’t yet integrated
  - If messages don’t get delivered by the postman, the message can be manually claimed by calling `claimMessage` with the `MessageSent` event parameters or by using the SDK.
- Update prover to integrate with the new architecture and support Batch Conflation

### Breaking changes

**Message bridge**

- Bridging partners will need to listen to different events. Modifications to the events are seen below:

          <code>L1L2MessageHashesAddedToInbox</code>
        </td>
        <td>
          L1→L2 message hash has been anchored on L2 and can be claimed on block
          finalization.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

- The anchoring and execution (claim) process has been separated into 2 steps. The deadline concept has been completely removed.
