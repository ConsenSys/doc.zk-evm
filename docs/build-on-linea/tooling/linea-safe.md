## What is Linea Safe?

Linea Safe is a fork managed by the Linea team in collaboration with Protofire, an official partner of the Safe team. It is a multi-signature smart contract wallet, which means it requires a minimum number of signatures to approve a transaction before it can occur. For example, if your business has three main stakeholders, you can configure the wallet to require approval from either two out of three or all three individuals before a transaction can proceed. This security measure ensures that no single person can compromise the funds.

On top of that, Linea Safe gives complete self custody over funds and the smart contract that is deployed is completely trustless and in control.
