description: Use Linea Safe to create a multi-signature smart contract wallet
---

Linea Safe is a multi-signature smart contract wallet.

This means it requires a minimum number of signatures to approve a transaction before it can occur.
If, for example, you have 3 main stakeholders in your business, you could set up the wallet to
"require approval from 2 out of 3 (2/3)", or all 3 people, before the transaction is sent.
This assures that no single person could compromise the funds.

On top of that, Linea Safe gives complete self-custody over funds. In other words, the smart
contract deployed for the wallet has complete control over the wallet's contents, and does not
rely on any trusted external party for execution.
