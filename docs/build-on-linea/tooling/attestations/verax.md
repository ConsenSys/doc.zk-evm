Verax is a shared on-chain attestation registry. The teams that are actively involved in designing and building the project include Consensys (the team behind Linea), Clique, Karma3 Labs, Aspecta, PADO Labs, and Reclaim Protocol. A number of other teams including GitCoin are building integrations with the system.

**_It is not an EIP, a protocol, or a product, but a simple primitive that can be used by any dapps and protocols as a shared “data lake” of public data. In essence, it can be thought of as a backend or a database._**

Think of Verax as a distribution channel where issuers of attestations keep the attestations. Any protocol, dapp, or user that wants to use those attestations can easily use and compose attestations from the different sources that are available in that distribution channel. Examples of some of the integrations currently being built include Clique, GitCoin, PADO Labs and Reclaim Protocol.

## Use Cases

Verax can enable a wide range of use cases, including:

- Inclusive sybil resistance: dapps can have a high degree of confidence that their users are not bots without prescribing a narrow method of proving their humanity, which can impose a prerequisite on new users and introduce friction into the user experience. Imagine having a bot resistant Lens profile creation system without whitelists, based on sophisticated reputation protocols.

- Supporting a market for under-collateralized peer-to-peer lending based on robust, transparent and continually evolving reputation scores.

- Permissionless fraud detection and scam prevention: smart contracts and dapps can prove they are audited and can have a reputation based on usage and reviews etc.

- A powerful recommendation engine that allows people to discover new content and dapps that are relevant to them, without the need for a centralized curator.

## Proof of Humanity (POH)

Proof-of-Humanity systems ensure that participants in web3 are real humans and not bots. For example in the [Linea DeFi Voyage](https://linea.mirror.xyz/Y7Co9H1-oV0O51nKYW0eFPZSs2xn--YJ2wRJzEecN6o) these systems are run by our partners such as Gitcoin, Clique, and Aspecta, leveraging the Verax registry. End-users won’t directly interact with Verax at any point.
