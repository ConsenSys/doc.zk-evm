Noves is the leading provider of interpreted, human-readable data in the EVM space. Its flagship product, [Translate API](https://docs.noves.fi/reference/introduction), allows developers to retrieve transactions in fully-enriched, human-readable form.

For a sample of what this data looks like, you can check out [Linea for Humans](https://linea.forhumans.app), a human-readable block explorer built by Noves for Linea.

Translate covers more than 50 transaction types in its interpretation schema, including common transactions such as claiming rewards or staking (across thousands of protocols), but also more niche types such as governance delegation, MEV, NFT transformations, and [more](https://docs.noves.fi/reference/token).

## Cross-DEX pricing data

Noves Pricing API supports many DEX protocols on Linea, allowing developers to price a variety of tokens and LP tokens on the chain.

The API also offers historical pricing with block-level granularity. The price of any token / LP token can be requested as of a specific block. This is particularly useful for financial applications / reporting where establishing a precise cost-basis is necessary.
