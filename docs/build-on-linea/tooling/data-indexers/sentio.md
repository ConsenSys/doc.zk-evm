# Sentio

Sentio provides modern **analytics**, **monitoring**, **alerting and debugging** for decentralized applications as an **integrated** and **hosted** experience.

Users can use Sentio’s SDK to **collect** and **transform** [Metrics](https://docs.sentio.xyz/references/concepts/data-types/metrics) and [event-logs](https://docs.sentio.xyz/references/concepts/data-types/event-logs) generated based on their smart contracts’ events, transactions, traces and states. Sentio fully manages the indexing process, and users can visualize data in the [dashboard](https://docs.sentio.xyz/how-to-guides-by-examples/visualize-results/build-dashboards), set up [alerts](https://docs.sentio.xyz/references/concepts/alerts), perform advanced search on the logs, and dig into a transaction via [Sentio debugger](https://docs.sentio.xyz/sentio-debugger), all via Sentio’s web interface.
