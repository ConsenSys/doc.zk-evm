title: TheGraph Network
---

As a dApp developer, retrieving on-chain data for your dApp can be challenging because you will most likely:

1. Consume your RPC provider quota with calls.
2. Need to implement error handling on multiple levels.
3. Define creative strategies to avoid UX impacts when managing a high volume of data.

The Graph is a decentralized data indexer provider that indexes the Linea blockchain for you and exposes on-chain data through an HTTPS API.

We run The Graph indexers on Linea to allow you to leverage the power of this technology.

## Custom subgraph and deployments

If there are no public subgraph that matches your needs, in order to use TheGraph you will need to define your own subgraph and get it deployed on an indexer.

### Access Request (Whitelisting)

Access to the Deployer and IPFS endpoints in both networks need to be requested before deploying a subgraph. You will need the IP/s you will access the endpoints from (i.e. public source IP/s of the machine that will run the deploy). Please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/JcxhCwAToNgMSbrk9) to be whitelisted.

The network name must be set to either linea-mainnet for Mainnet or linea-goerli for Goerli.

Once whitelisted, the commands for deploying a subgraph are similar to the following:

```bash
graph codegen
graph create --node <deploy_endpoint> <team_repo>/<subgraph_name>
graph remove --node <deploy_endpoint> <team_repo>/<subgraph_name>
graph deploy --node <deploy_endpoint> --ipfs <ipfs_endpoint> --version-label <subgraph_version_label> <team_repo>/<subgraph_name>
```
