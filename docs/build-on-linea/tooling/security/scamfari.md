[Scamfari](https://scamfari.com) is a cybersecurity tool developed on the Linea blockchain, enabling users to report suspicious activities linked to malicious actors within the blockchain space. These malicious entities – including scammers and phishers – pose ongoing challenges in the blockchain community. Scamfari's approach involves having each user-submitted report undergo a thorough review by cybersecurity professionals to ensure the data's accuracy. Verified reports are subsequently integrated into various databases, notably the [HAPI Protocol](https://hapi.one), fortifying the collective defense against such threats.

By using Linea as its foundation, Scamfari exemplifies the practical application possibilities, especially those focusing on enhancing security within the blockchain ecosystem.
