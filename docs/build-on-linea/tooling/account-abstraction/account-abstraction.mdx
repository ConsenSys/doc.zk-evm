title: Account abstraction
---

`Account abstraction` is a broad category of fast-moving development in the Ethereum ecosystem. It generally refers to different ways to create and manage accounts, other than using a Secret Recovery Phrase and a wallet.

One milestone in this area was the inclusion of [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) in the Ethereum protocol. 

 This includes, but is not limited to:

 - Creating accounts using a cryptographic library running in a dapp (an "embedded wallet")
 - The creation of an account that is to some degree controlled by a smart contract

That second point may seem small, but it enables things like:

 - Account Recovery ("social recovery", recovery via email or other identities or accounts)
 - Use case-specific limitations
 - Paying for a user's gas fees
 - Delegation of assets

and a *lot more*.

As a network, Linea is heavily invested in innovating in the account abstraction space; consult the resources here to see how you can implement the tools we already have... and then build your own.
