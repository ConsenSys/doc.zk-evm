[Cookbook.dev](https://www.cookbook.dev/?utm=lineadocs) is an open-source smart contract registry where developers can find solidity primitives, libraries, and smart contracts for protocols.

In this tutorial, we'll walk through searching for a protocol on Cookbook and deploying it to Linea using Cookbook's no-code deploy and using Cookbook with Remix, Hardhat and Foundry.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you've:

1. [Set up your wallet](../../../use-mainnet/set-up-your-wallet.mdx)
2. [Funded your wallet with Linea ETH](../../../use-mainnet/fund.mdx) on either the testnet or mainnet

## Search Cookbook's Smart Contract Registry

Navigate to [cookbook.dev/chains/Linea](https://www.cookbook.dev/chains/Linea?utm=lineadocs) and explore **Protocols** on Linea, or search for specific smart contracts in the search bar.

      alt="Cookbook Search"
    />
  </div>
</div>

To learn about a smart contract on Cookbook, select the protocol, and select `Expand`. This opens the code alongside ChefGPT, Cookbook's AI Solidity assistant.

Highlight selections of the code and press **Analyze Snippet** to get more information about the smart contract code you're looking at, or ask ChefGPT questions about Linea, solidity, or your smart contract.

      src="/img/article_images/Build_on_Linea/Quickstart/Deploy_a_smart_contract/Cookbook/Linea_deploy_smart_contract_Cookbook_4.png"
      alt="Cookbook No Code Deploy"
    />
  </div>
</div>

Connect your Metamask Wallet to Cookbook.dev.

Set your smart contract arguments within the Cookbook UI (if applicable).

Select Linea or tLinea (Linea Testnet) under **Pick Chain**.

Select **Deploy** and pay the network fee.

Manage your deployed smart contract under **My Dashboard** in Cookbook.

## Deploy your Smart Contract to Linea with Remix

### Method #1 - Using the Cookbook.dev Website and Opening in Remix

On a smart contract or protocol page in Cookbook, select the **Open in Remix** option. Your smart contract will automatically be opened in a new Remix workspace.

<div class="center-container">
  <a href="https://remix.ethereum.org/#activate=cookbookdev&#deactivate=cookbook.dev&version=soljson-v0.8.12.js&call=cookbookdev//openContract//simple-token&lang=en&optimize=false&runs=200&evmVersion=null" target="_blank">
  <div class="img-small">
      <img
      src="/img/article_images/Build_on_Linea/Quickstart/Deploy_a_smart_contract/Cookbook/Linea_deploy_smart_contract_Cookbook_5.png"
      alt="Cookbook Open in Remix"
    />
  </div>
  </a>
</div>

:::tip Click the "Open in Remix" button above to actually open the smart contract code in the Remix IDE! :::

**Compile** your smart contract within Remix. Most contracts opened with Cookbook will automatically compile within Remix.

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-small">
      <img
      src="/img/article_images/Build_on_Linea/Quickstart/Deploy_a_smart_contract/Cookbook/Linea_deploy_smart_contract_Cookbook_6.png"
      alt="Cookbook Remix Compile"
    />
  </div>
</div>

Once compiled, **deploy** the smart contract in Remix.

Connect your Metamask wallet with Linea Goerli or Linea mainnet by selecting injected provider - Metamask Wallet in the **environments** tab within the **deploy** screen.

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-small">
      <img
      src="/img/article_images/Build_on_Linea/Quickstart/Deploy_a_smart_contract/Cookbook/Linea_deploy_smart_contract_Cookbook_7.png"
      alt="Cookbook Remix Deploy"
    />
  </div>
</div>

Once deployed, we can interact with our smart contract within Remix.

### Method #2 - Using the Cookbook Remix Plug-in within the Remix IDE

Go to [Remix.Ethereum.org](https://remix.ethereum.org)

Add The Cookbook Plugin to Remix by clicking the Chef Hat Logo under **Featured Plugins** on the Remix Homepage.

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-medium">
      <img
      src="/img/article_images/Build_on_Linea/Quickstart/Deploy_a_smart_contract/Cookbook/Linea_deploy_smart_contract_Cookbook_8.png"
      alt="Cookbook Remix Featured Plugin"
    />
  </div>
</div>

Alternatively, search Cookbook and select **Activate** in the Remix Plugin Manager.

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-small">
      <img
      src="/img/article_images/Build_on_Linea/Quickstart/Deploy_a_smart_contract/Cookbook/Linea_deploy_smart_contract_Cookbook_9.png"
      alt="Cookbook Remix Add Plugin"
    />
  </div>
</div>

Search for any protocol or smart contract and click the search result to import the smart contract code into Remix.

Cookbook's AI solidity co-pilot, ChefGPT, is available within the Remix plugin to answer questions about Linea, Solidity, or the smart contract you're working with.

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-small">
      <img
      src="/img/article_images/Build_on_Linea/Quickstart/Deploy_a_smart_contract/Cookbook/Linea_deploy_smart_contract_Cookbook_10.png"
      alt="Cookbook Remix Search"
    />
  </div>
</div>

Compile and deploy the smart contract as described in **Method 1** above.

## Deploy your Smart Contract to Linea with Hardhat

After finding the smart contract or protocol you want to work with in [Cookbook](https://www.cookbook.dev/?utm=lineadocs), select the **Download Source** option and select **Hardhat** to download the contract boilerplate. For this guide, we'll use [Cookbook's Simple ERC-20 Token Smart Contract](https://www.cookbook.dev/contracts/simple-token?utm=lineadocs).

To install the required packages and dependencies, run

```
npm install
```

To compile your smart contract, run

```
npx hardhat compile
```

Add arguments to the `constructorArgs` array in the `deploy.js` file in the `scripts` folder and save. If you do not need any arguments please leave the array empty.

### Deploy To Linea

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Deploy To Linea Goerli (Testnet)" label="Testnet" default>

In your `.env.example` file, add your Infura Linea Goerli API key and add your wallet private key. Afterward change the name of the file to .env and create a gitignore to ignore your .env file.

    In the `hardhat.config.js` file, uncomment out the example code

```
const INFURA_API_KEY_LINEA_GOERLI = process.env.INFURA_API_KEY_LINEA_GOERLI;
```

and uncomment out

```
const PRIVATE_KEY = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY;
```

and then uncomment out

```
lineaGoerli: {
url: `https://linea-goerli.infura.io/v3/${INFURA_API_KEY_LINEA_GOERLI}`,
accounts: [PRIVATE_KEY],
},
```

To deploy your smart contract to the Linea testnet, run

```
npx hardhat run --network (lineaGoerli) scripts/deploy.js
```

Hardhat will return the deployed smart contract address in your terminal. View and verify your smart contract on the [Linea Goerli Block Explorer](https://goerli.lineascan.build/). 
</TabItem> 

<TabItem value="Deploy To Linea (Mainnet)" label="Mainnet">

In your `.env.example` file, add your Infura Linea API key and add your wallet private key. Afterward change the name of the file to .env and create a gitignore to ignore your .env file.

Add

```
  INFURA_API_KEY_LINEA = "<YOUR API KEY HERE>"

```

    In the `hardhat.config.js` file, add

```
const INFURA_API_KEY_LINEA = process.env.INFURA_API_KEY_LINEA;
```

and uncomment out

```
const PRIVATE_KEY = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY;
```

and then add

```
linea: {
url: `https://linea.infura.io/v3/${INFURA_API_KEY_LINEA}`,
accounts: [PRIVATE_KEY],
},
```

To deploy your smart contract to the Linea testnet, run

```
npx hardhat run --network (linea) scripts/deploy.js
```

Hardhat will return the deployed smart contract address in your terminal. View and verify your smart contract on the [Linea Block Explorer](https://lineascan.build/). 
</TabItem> 

</Tabs>

## Deploy your Smart Contract to Linea with Foundry

After finding the smart contract or protocol you want to work with in [Cookbook](https://www.cookbook.dev/chains/Linea?utm=lineadocs), select the **Download Source** option and select **Foundry** to download the contract boilerplate.For this guide, we'll use [Cookbook's Simple ERC-20 Token Smart Contract](https://www.cookbook.dev/contracts/simple-token?utm=lineadocs).

Before you can use Foundry, you need to install Rust, a programming language required to run Foundry. Follow the installation instructions provided [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html).

Once Rust is installed, you can install Foundry. Follow the installation instructions provided [here](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation#using-foundryup).

To build your contracts, Run

```sh
forge build
```

If you encounter a "stack too deep" error, try running the following command instead

```sh
forge build --via
```

In the scripts folder, uncomment all the code in the `contract.s.sol` file. Replace `"ARG1"`, `"ARG2"`, `2000` with your `Token Name`, `Token Symbol` and desired `Token Quantity` where you see the code below

```
FixedToken _contract = new FixedToken("ARG1", "ARG2", 2000);
```

Before deploying your contracts, populate the `.env` file with your [Linea Goerli RPC URL](https://www.infura.io/networks/ethereum/linea), followed by your [Metamask wallet private key](https://metamask.io/) and your [Etherscan API key token values](https://etherscan.io/apis). Then, run the following command to define your environment variables globally

```sh
source .env
```

:::tip add "0x" before your private key string in the `.env` file :::

Deploy your contracts with the following command

```sh
forge script script/contract.s.sol:ContractScript --rpc-url $GOERLI_RPC_URL --broadcast --verify -vvvv
```

Your contract will be verified on the Linea Goerli explorer automatically upon deployment. You can manage and interact with your newly deployed smart contract in the [Linea Goerli block explorer](https://goerli.lineascan.build/).

:::note
 The given tests in the contract.t.sol file are only examples, please generate your own :::
