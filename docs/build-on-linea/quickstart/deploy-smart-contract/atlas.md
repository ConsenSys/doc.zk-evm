Atlas is a 0-setup tool for writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts.

You will need a Metamask wallet and Linea eth (testnet or mainnet) to deploy to the chain. If you need funds, [check out the bridge.](https://bridge.linea.build/)

## How to deploy
1. Go to https://app.atlaszk.com
2. Go to the top right and change the network to Linea / Linea Goerli 
3. Press Deploy

That’s it!

Now that you’ve got your feet wet, you can write tests for your contract (foundry is built in), ask the ai to help you write your contracts, write deploy scripts, and more.
