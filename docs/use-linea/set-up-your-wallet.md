The MetaMask extension wallet provides a default Linea network. There's no special wallet setup necessary! All you need to interact with Linea is to download MetaMask, which you can [install as a browser extension or mobile app](https://metamask.io/download/).

Because Linea is currently only in public testnet, you'll need to click on `Show/hide test networks` to have it displayed. Afterwards, select the Linea network, and you're good to go!

## Using Linea on MetaMask mobile

If you want to use Linea on mobile, you'll need to follow the mobile instructions to [add it manually](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360043227612-How-to-add-a-custom-network-RPC#h_01G63GGJ83DGDRCS2ZWXM37CV5) using [this network information](../developers/useful-info.md#network-information).

## Other wallets

Linea is compatible with any EVM-compatible wallet. If you want to add the Linea network, you can find the relevant network information under [Network information and deployed contracts](../developers/useful-info.md#network-information).
