The MetaMask extension wallet provides a default Linea network - there's no special wallet setup necessary! All you need to interact with Linea is to download MetaMask, which you can [install as a browser extension or mobile app](https://metamask.io/download/). Afterwards, select the Linea network, and you're good to go!
