# The Escape

On this page you will see 20 tokens, 8 of them are risk-free, and your mission is to find all 8 of them. Press the `submit in` button when you are done selecting, and if all of them are correct, congratulations, you have successfully escaped from the Fortress.

# Use GoPlus Security Detection to Help

Of course, it is hard to eyeball and check the legitimacy of the tokens, and that's why you need GoPlus Token Security to help. Click token detection details under each toke, and you will be directed to the "GoPlus Token Security" page, where we will list all the security information of the token.

Carefully read through every line on the page to see if there are risks in the token's contract or if the token is a honeypot. If the token is risk-free, go back to the main page and click the check-mark.
