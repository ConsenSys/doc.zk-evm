## Preparing your wallet for the Linea Testnet


If you don't have any tokens in your wallet yet, you have two options:

2.  Or go to the [Linea Faucet Site](https://faucet.goerli.linea.build) and verify for testnet tokens
    

Make sure to turn on “show/hide test network” option on Metamask and connect to the Linea Goerli Testnet
