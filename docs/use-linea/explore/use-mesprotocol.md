2. Choose to trade in “Single Chain Mode” or “Cross-rollup Mode”, this is what differentiates MES from other DEXs.

- In Single Chain Mode - your order placed is matched and settled with other orders on Linea (your currently connected chain) only.
- In Cross-Rollup Mode, your order could match and settle with orders on any chains supported by MES. You enjoy deeper liquidity in this mode, but you may need to bridge the assets when you withdraw.
