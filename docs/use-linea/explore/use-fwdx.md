# FWDX.xyz

FWDX.xyz is a Decentralized P2P Swap Protocol that provides an open interest orderbook where quotes are firm and fills are guaranteed. Swap orders have zero price-slippage, what you see is what you get, with no deviation from the quoted price.

In this guide, we'll walk you through how to Create Market, Swap & Fill Markets with FWDX.

## Before You Begin

Before you start, make sure your wallet is configured as follows:

1. [Configured to use Linea](../set-up-your-wallet.md).
2. [Funded with Goerli ETH](../fund.md#get-test-eth-on-goerli)
3. [Funded with Linea Faucet ERC20 Tokens](https://faucet.goerli.linea.build/)

FWDX currently provides support for the following test networks:

- Goerli Testnet
- Linea Testnet
- Polygon zkEVM Testnet

To access the dApp, users can connect their wallets through Metamask or WalletConnect. Note that connecting to the Linea Goerli Test Network is required for the specific tasks in this guide.

## Create Market

To create a market, follow the steps below:

1. Connect your wallet to [https://testnet.fwdx.xyz](https://testnet.fwdx.xyz).
2. Select the "Send Token" and specify the desired amount.
3. Choose the "Receive Token" and indicate the desired amount.
4. Determine the length of time you want the offer to remain open (Validity).

The user will need to perform two transactions:

- **Approve**: Grant permission to the FWDX Smart Contract to access your send token for creating the market pool.
- **Create Market**: Initiate the creation of the actual market.

That's it! You have successfully created a market using FWDX.
