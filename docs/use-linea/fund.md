Use [MetaMask](https://docs.metamask.io/guide/getting-started.html) to store your funds and interact with Linea. You can [install MetaMask as a browser extension or mobile app](https://metamask.io/download/).

## Get test ETH on Goerli

Use a faucet to obtain Goerli ETH. Transactions are much cheaper than Mainnet. Therefore 0.1 ETH is enough to execute a basic workflow. You can [view a list of faucets](https://faucetlink.to/goerli) for the Goerli network.

## Get test USDC on Goerli

To obtain test USDC on Goerli, use our [USDC faucet](https://bridge.goerli.linea.build/send?token=USDC) to mint 10 USDC. You must have some Goerli test ETH to pay for the transaction to mint USDC.

Next, you'll need to [bridge your funds to Linea](bridge-funds.md) to interact with the network.
