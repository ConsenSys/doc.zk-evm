See something missing? Error in our documentation? Create an issue [here](https://github.com/Consensys/doc.linea/issues).

Alternatively, help us improve our documentation! [Fork our repo](https://github.com/ConsenSys/doc.linea/fork),
create a pull request, and tag us for review. (For help on this, see [below](#how-to-submit-a-suggestion-or-change)).

## Guide

If you don't intend to make the changes yourself, and simply want to report a bug or request an 
update, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/Consensys/doc.linea/issues) or get in touch
via the [community forum](https://community.linea.build/) or the [Linea Discord](https://discord.gg/linea).

Please follow these steps if you wish to contribute:
1. Please make an issue describing the change you wish to make _before_ you start working on it, and
[link to it in your pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue).
This is particularly important if you are an ecosystem contributor â€” submitting your details in an 
issue first will make it much easier for our docs team to process your contributions.
2. [Fork our repo](https://github.com/ConsenSys/doc.linea/fork) so that you're able to work on it. 
3. Make your changes, paying attention to our [contribution guidelines](#contribution-guidelines).
4. Review your changes locally. See our [guide](./README.mdx#running-locally) on previewing your 
changes locally.
5. Submit your changes as a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
New pull requests are reviewed regularly.

## Contribution guidelines

The style of the documentation is based on the [Consensys style guide](https://docs-template.consensys.net/contribute/style-guide).

Please return to any submitted PRs regularly to help us work through feedback and comments and 
merge them as soon as we can. If you do not return to your PR for edits within three months of us 
reviewing, we will close the PR. 

### Guidance for ecosystem contributions

By "ecosystem contributions", we mean contributions from projects in the Linea ecosystem, such as 
dapps, libraries, or other tooling. If your submission is in this category, please keep the following
guidelines in mind:

- Your contribution should be informative above all; the docs are not a marketing tool for your 
project. We may request edits to adjust your writing style if we feel it falls on the wrong side of 
this line. We encourage you to write about your project's features and benefits, but please avoid 
superlatives.
- You are responsible for maintaining the information about your project. Out-of-date docs will be 
an inconvenience for users at best, or leave a negative impression of your project at worst. This 
includes keeping links to external sites up-to-date and returning for updates as your project
matures.

## Contribute to community tutorials

If you've created fleshed-out guides and tutorials, or intend to, we'd love to feature your content
in our [community tutorials section](./docs/developers/guides/community/index.mdx).

First, create an issue describing the content you want to see added or intend to add. If you're
representing an organization (such as a dapp), please use the ecosystem contribution issue form.

When you're ready to start work, [fork our repo](https://github.com/Consensys/doc.linea/fork),
create a pull request, and tag us for review!

## Contribute to the Zero-Knowledge Glossary

Diving into zero-knowledge rollups and getting stumped by the technical jargon? We've started an
open source Zero-Knowledge glossary to define some common terms you might encounter as you dive
into the L2 landscape.

[Fork our repo](https://github.com/Consensys/doc.linea/fork), and add a term in alphabetical
order to `docs/reference/glossary.md`. Then, make a pull request and tag us for review!
